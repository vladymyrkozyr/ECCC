In 1908, the Board of Railway Commissioners assumed jurisdiction over Canada's early telephone and telegraph toll charges. 

And in 1910, the Board ruled that the CP, which was operating a telegraph news service, was using discriminatory pricing by charging a higher price for delivering messages that originated with other news services. In the telephone industry, a similar principle was used when Bell Telephone, which had a monopoly in a large part of Canada, was prohibited from providing content-based services. 

The Board's ruling established a basic principle of Canadian telecommunications - the separation of control of message content from control of transmission - an early expression of what is now called ""net neutrality"".
