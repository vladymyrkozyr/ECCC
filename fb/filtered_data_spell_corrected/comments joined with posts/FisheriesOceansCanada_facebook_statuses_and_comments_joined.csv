All of these resources brought Ottawa an enormous amount of revenue. We are deemed to be a “have” province but yet we have none of our raw natural resources working for us and the only way our provincial government knows how to raise revenue, it appears, is to tax our people to death all the while giving away our natural resources in the raw state so that others can build smelting, processing and manufacturing economies. We in NL, are not on the receiving end of equalization payments as we are deemed to be NOT eligible. We have the Muskrat Falls Hydroelectric Project presently ongoing which when completed, we are told, will make the citizens of our province completely destitute when it comes on stream, as the province of Nova Scotia will be the beneficiary at cents per kilowatt hour of that energy, while our NL citizens will have to pay up to cents per kilowatt hour almost times what Nova Scotians will be paying.

Once you take their money, then you accept their jurisdiction with it too and give yours up, plain and simple, they should never have signed those agreements with D.F.O., all they were was to limit our access to the commercial fisheries. The Supreme Court of Canada ruling in Donald Marshalls case clearly stated that all Mi'gmaq had a right to earn a modest living from the commercial fishery, all not a few, when the band councils signed those agreements, they accepted the handful of licenses that came with these restrictive agreements and their law that came with these agreements. I told our band council in or so at that time not sign them because the only people that will benefit will be the non native fishermen who were selling their licenses and their rotting boats and fishing equipment to our people, and that's exactly what happened, some of the boats that were bought by the band council never saw water because they were not sea worthy and would have sunk, and to think D.F.O. Knew about these unfit boat deals and didn't stop them. We could have had china invest in our own commercial fishery at that time and were to invest their money because they saw the extra aboriginal commercial fishery quotas in which they could buy from us. I had in hired a Chinese business woman from B.C. go to china and secure the necessary agreements in principle that would have seen the Chinese invest in buying new boats, financing fish plants throughout our Districts and shared that with the chief and council at that time, they didn't want to hear of it, the chief and his executive director at that time were tripping over their feet running down the band council steps to high tail it to Moncton or Fredericton to sign the D.F.O agreements, now years later these D.F.O.

Those D.F.O. Marshall agreements that were signed by the majority of band council chiefs throughout our seven Districts when the Supreme Court ruling came out is the reason why D.F.O. Is talking tough on our fishermen selling lobster when fishing under communal licenses. Once you take their money, then you accept their jurisdiction with it too and give yours up, plain and simple, they should never have signed those agreements with D.F.O., all they were was to limit our access to the commercial fisheries. The Supreme Court of Canada ruling in Donald Marshalls case clearly stated that all Mi'gmaq had a right to earn a modest living from the commercial fishery, all not a few, when the band councils signed those agreements, they accepted the handful of licenses that came with these restrictive agreements and their law that came with these agreements. I told our band council in 2000 or so at that time not sign them because the only people that will benefit will be the non native fishermen who were selling their licenses and their rotting boats and fishing equipment to our people, and that's exactly what happened, some of the boats that were bought by the band council never saw water because they were not sea worthy and would have sunk, and to think D.F.O. Knew about these unfit boat deals and didn't stop them. We could have had china invest in our own commercial fishery at that time and were to invest their money because they saw the extra aboriginal commercial fishery quotas in which they could buy from us. I had in 1997 hired a Chinese business woman from B.C. go to china and secure the necessary agreements in principle that would have seen the Chinese invest in buying new boats, financing fish plants throughout our Districts and shared that with the chief and council at that time, they didn't want to hear of it, the chief and his executive director at that time were tripping over their feet running down the band council steps to high tail it to Moncton or Fredericton to sign the D.F.O agreements, now 17 years later these D.F.O. Agreements are coming back to haunt the fishermen, so of course the Feds will say, ""a deal is a deal"" you  took the money and we take control, fair and square.",0.09256465756465754,Neutral,Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/FisheriesOceansCanada/photos/a.331203093968397.1073741828.315919208830119/357218368033536/?type=3,2017-09-12 13:48:12,537,208,517,502,11,4,14,0,6,0,"The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that there is an Aboriginal right to fish for food, social and ceremonial purposes.

Consultation that was held here recently? First they say that they just want to inform you of changes, and then they go back and implant their regulations often most times limiting or restricting our fishery in some way, and when we question how they can do that, they say you were consulted. The band councils never learn, taking that easy money means there's a price to pay for dealing with the devil, our 7th District Tribal council in the near future will be developing our own harvesting laws in fishery and other resource harvesting outside of the Indian act band council boundaries where our ancestral original governing system can assert its jurisdiction, as long as the harvesting is done in a responsible manner, respecting conservation, as we did with our Salmon Fishery law adopted in the early 90s. We are not bound by the Indian act and its restrictive legislation, we assert our authority and jurisdiction through using aboriginal title and that our District lands are still unceded Mi'gmaq Indian lands, something that the band councils should be doing instead of negotiating with Canada, and Quebec in their extinguishment and surrender land claims negotiations. Many of our people do not know that these MMS land claims and self government negotiations with Canada and Quebec are in the agreement in principle stage, the next step is the final stage, they haven't even show us what they have been secretly negotiating behind closed doors and the agreement in principle document, ask your council members to provide this document. As political representatives of our treaty rights and our collective lands they should have access to these documents, they cannot claim that they do not know, it's their job and fiduciary responsibility to know how our treaty rights and our collective titles to our lands are being used in these negotiations and are being done so without ever directly asking for our consent. We asked the former chief Scott Martin and his councillors to provide these documents in a letter sent sent to them by our Tribal council in 2016,but they refused and ignored our request, he and other councillors are no longer in power now because of their unwillingness to be open and honest about how our treaty rights and collective land tiles are being used as commodities to be sold to Canada and Quebec. Chief Darcy Gray and some of the new councillors that that got elected in 2016 promised open accountability if they got elected at several of our Tribal council meetings they attended looking for our support, we are still waiting for that open accountability, it seems that they got swallowed up by the Indian act beast as one elder used to use that phrase when newly elected councillors got the taste of the fringe benefits that came with being a councillor.

You have Elders, children, sick, disabled, allergic and people that don't even want to fish in the native community so looking at less than 1 %. According to the Marshall decision look that up native aboriginals have the right to sell fish for as low or as high as they like and  there is nothing illegal. In Canada the amount of registered status Indians is between 849,000 to 1.4 million. This population of active fishermen in Canada are about 2,733,762 to 3,000,000 million. That a 1:6 ratio.  Conserving the population of fishing should be limite for non Aboriginals. So for 6 non Aboriginals 5 should by cut off from fishing licenses.

Technically salmon and rainbow and brown trout are all invasive in great lakes yet they spawned a multi billion dollar a year fishery and commercial fishery. Gobies which are invasive to great lakes used to be bad news...however eapecially in lake huron where we lost our alewives and consequncly % of our chinook salmon due to invasive musels filtering out the plankton and nutrients alewives needed to live...the gobies invaded...turns out the gobies find the mussels a delicasy!!! Inturn the lake trout and coho and browns and rainbow learned to adapt to gobies here and all species except the chinook (who r to picky and refuse to adapt to ensure there species) are thriving and then some on the gobies.

Unfortunately, the waters around many Canadian harbours aren’t as clean as they could be. Recently, our researchers from Newfoundland and Labrador, Corey Morris & Dan Porter, presented results from a survey of 18 harbours over 10 years. During scientific dives, they unexpectedly found, and videotaped, lots of garbage – everything from carpet, rubber gloves, rubber boots to appliances like BBQs, stove, even a washer with laundry still inside. Everyone has a role in protecting the ocean and the creatures that live there. Reduce the garbage going into the ocean by recycling, reusing and refusing plastic where you can.",Environmental

Here is the report: Notable points: Pg. : ""There are no indications that vessel traffic in was significantly different than or previous years nor that pattern of use deviated from previously observed."" Pg. : ""... involvement of an infectious disease in this mortality event is unlikely ..."" UNLIKELY? That is CLEARLY an opinion. Pg. : ""Trauma caused by human interaction, particularly vessel collision, has been a major cause of mortality in the population of North Atlantic right whales (Laist et al. ; Moore et al. ). Campbell-Malone et al. (2008)."" These sources were PRIOR to Zika and Wolbachia-infected Aedes releases. Can we not look at the phylogenetics of Zika, a novel pathogen, for a moment? Whales have suffered West Nile virus and St. Louis encephalitis viruses and Zika shares this clade with over percent support. Source: N.A. right whales have been spotted as far south as the Bahamas and Mexico. They often have mouth abrasions. There are multiple ways Zika and/or Wolbachia could be infecting them. Mosquito bites are merely ONE way. Are we going to foolishly cling to Hertig's results on mice and chicken embryos? Or, are we going to acknowledge and devote resources to testing vertebrates (including humans) for the presence of Wolbachia? Because here are facts that are being willfully ignored: The direct effect of Wolbachia can either impede or promote the pathogen's replication and survival (Zug and Hammerstein, ). Examples of neutral or pro-pathogenic effect of Wolbachia include: Brugia pahangi (Dutton and Sinkins, ); Japanese encephalitis (JE) Virus (Tsai et al., ); Drosophila C Virus (Osborne et al., ); and Plasmodium gallinaceum (Baton et al., ). Wolbachia Enhances West Nile Virus (WNV) Infection in the Mosquito Culex tarsalis: Zika Virus in Salivary Glands of Five Different Species of Wild-Caught Mosquitoes from Mexico: 1 Both Wolbachia and Zika are maternally inherited. This reproductive parasite (Wolbachia) and the Zika virus are in the eggs and larvae of mosquitoes which copepods and krill feed on. Some species only partially eat Aedes larvae causing their contents to spill out into sea water. Over ,000 cases of Zika were reported in Puerto Rico as of Oct. th, . The waters surrounding many islands in the Caribbean are obviously teeming with Zika-infected Aedes and Culex mosquitoes, eggs, and larvae. Testing for Zika should be a no-brainer to any seasoned pathologist. The ONLY conclusion that can solidly be drawn from this pathology report: TWO whales out of died from entanglement. The four or five attributed to blunt trauma based on ""severe internal bleeding"" could also be caused by infections or bleeding in transport or even foul play. When I asked Dr. Daoust about Zika, WNV, SLEV, and Wolbachia, he replied that these whales were in various states of decomposition, downplayed the likelihood of a mosquito biting them, and therefore these were not even considered or tested for. My own data (based on organic visits to a reference-based article I wrote about Zika in men) confirmed my worst fears: Overnight-active Culex spp. are probably responsible for the worst manifestations of the Zika. And Wolbachia is likely providing the mode of transportation to the gonads, heart, CNS, optic lobe, and retina. Zika (in men) has moved further north, into New York, the U.K. and Canada.

Mortality Event in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, 2017. Here is the report: http://www.cwhc-rcsf.ca/right_whales.php

Notable points:

Pg. 27: ""There are no indications that vessel traffic in 2017 was significantly different than 2016 or previous years nor that pattern of use deviated from previously observed.""

Pg. 16: ""... involvement of an infectious disease in this mortality event is unlikely ...""

UNLIKELY? That is CLEARLY an opinion.

Pg. 16: ""Trauma caused by human interaction, particularly vessel collision, has been a major cause of mortality in the population of North Atlantic right whales (Laist et al. 2001; Moore et al. 2004). Campbell-Malone et al. (2008).""

These sources were PRIOR to Zika and Wolbachia-infected Aedes releases.

Can we not look at the phylogenetics of Zika, a novel pathogen, for a moment? 

Whales have suffered West Nile virus and St. Louis encephalitis viruses and Zika shares this clade with over 97 percent support. Source: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01248/full

N.A. right whales have been spotted as far south as the Bahamas and Mexico. They often have mouth abrasions. There are multiple ways Zika and/or Wolbachia could be infecting them. Mosquito bites are merely ONE way.

Are we going to foolishly cling to Hertig's 1936 results on mice and chicken embryos? Or, are we going to acknowledge and devote resources to testing vertebrates (including humans) for the presence of Wolbachia?

Because here are facts that are being willfully ignored:

The direct effect of Wolbachia can either impede or promote the pathogen's replication and survival (Zug and Hammerstein, 2015). Examples of neutral or pro-pathogenic effect of Wolbachia include: Brugia pahangi (Dutton and Sinkins, 2005); Japanese encephalitis (JE) Virus (Tsai et al., 2006); Drosophila C Virus (Osborne et al., 2009); and Plasmodium gallinaceum (Baton et al., 2013).

Wolbachia Enhances West Nile Virus (WNV) Infection in the Mosquito Culex tarsalis: http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0002965

Zika Virus in Salivary Glands of Five Different Species of Wild-Caught Mosquitoes from Mexico: http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/19/151951

Both Wolbachia and Zika are maternally inherited. This reproductive parasite (Wolbachia) and the Zika virus are in the eggs and larvae of mosquitoes which copepods and krill feed on. 

Some species only partially eat Aedes larvae causing their contents to spill out into sea water.

Over 28,000 cases of Zika were reported in Puerto Rico as of Oct. 26th, 2016. The waters surrounding many islands in the Caribbean are obviously teeming with Zika-infected Aedes and Culex mosquitoes, eggs, and larvae. 

Testing for Zika should be a no-brainer to any seasoned pathologist. 

The ONLY conclusion that can solidly be drawn from this pathology report: TWO whales out of 15 died from entanglement. The four or five attributed to blunt trauma based on ""severe internal bleeding"" could also be caused by infections or bleeding in transport or even foul play. 

When I asked Dr. Daoust about Zika, WNV, SLEV, and Wolbachia, he replied that these whales were in various states of decomposition, downplayed the likelihood of a mosquito biting them, and therefore these were not even considered or tested for.

My own data (based on organic visits to a reference-based article I wrote about Zika in men) confirmed my worst fears:

Overnight-active Culex spp. are probably responsible for the worst manifestations of the Zika. And Wolbachia is likely providing the mode of transportation to the gonads, heart, CNS, optic lobe, and retina. Zika (in men) has moved further north, into New York, the U.K. and Canada.
