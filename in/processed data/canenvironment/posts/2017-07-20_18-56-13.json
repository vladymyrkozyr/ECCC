    "caption": "Symbol of Expo 67, the sphere designed by visionary architect Buckminster Fuller holds an important place in the history of contemporary architecture. Since 1995, the Biosph\u00e8re is a site devoted to environmental action and education.\n\nThe museum distinguishes itself by its interactive and educational exhibits as well as animated activities which are aimed at increasing understanding of major environmental issues such as air, water, biodiversity, climate change, sustainable development and more.\n\nIn fact, this unique structure uses a number of green technologies: wind turbines, green roof systems, a geothermal system, wastewater treatment wetlands and solar panels.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#MTLMoments #Expo67 #MTL375 #MontrealMuseums #Montreal #Environment #EnvironmentCanada #Museum #Canada #Montreal",
