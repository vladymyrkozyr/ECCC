    "caption": "What a cool blast from the past! \nCanadian Wildlife Service biologist Ron Mackay examines a Trumpeter Swan in the 1950s. In 1933, because of hunting and harassment, there were only 77 Trumpeters in Canada and 50 in the US. Today, as a result of an intensive international conservation effort, there are about 16 000 wild Trumpeter Swans, and the species is no longer considered in danger of extinction.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#Canada150 #TBT #throwbackthursday #throwback #CanadianWildlifeService #FlashBack #Retro #BlackAndWhite #CanadianWildife #Swan #BiologistOfInstagram #FieldWork #WildlifeConservation #CanEnvironment #EnvironmentCanada #Canada #ProtectedArea #TrumpeterSwan #WithNature",
