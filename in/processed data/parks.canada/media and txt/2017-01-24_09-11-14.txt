Today is a very special day: the 100th anniversary of National Historic Sites in Canada! ðŸŽ‰
Thereâ€™s no better way to celebrate #NHS100 than by visiting where it all started: #FortAnne. For centuries, a succession of Scottish, French, First Nations and English settlers clashed over the ownership of the land surrounding Fort Anne. In 1916, this prized piece of land on the banks of #NovaScotiaâ€™s Annapolis River finally became Canadaâ€™s first national historic site.
