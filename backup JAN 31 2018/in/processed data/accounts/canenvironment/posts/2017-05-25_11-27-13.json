Because of the tight schedule of the ship our only opportunity to get out in Zodiacs below the seabird cliffs was at 6:30 before breakfast but despite this and a biting cold wind, about 80 passengers took part and all were thrilled by the experience!\u201d \u2013 Garry, CWS Crew\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\ud83d\udcf8: Garry Donaldson\n#CanadianWildlifeService #MigratoryBirds #AdventureCanada #MigratoryBirdSanctuary #ProtectedLand #WildlifePhotography #Nunavut #EnvironmentCanada #CanEnvironment #SummerVibes #NoFilterNeeded #EyeCandy",
