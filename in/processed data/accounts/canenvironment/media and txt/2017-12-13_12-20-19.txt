Guess what? We built two “supersites” in Iqaluit and Whitehorse! A supersite has a variety of weather instruments that allow scientists to measure atmospheric conditions in detail. 
For people living in the North, information like the temperature and humidity isn’t as important as they are in the South. Knowing about blowing snow and ice-fog (a fog made up of small ice crystals suspended in the air!) are much more relevant! 
The new sites will help us understand what weather instruments will work best, so that we can improve weather forecasts in the North.
