Taking classrooms to the great outdoors! Students helped spread thousands of milkweed seeds at Cartwright and Spooky Hollow Nature Sanctuaries in an effort to conserve monarchs and their habitat. Thanks to the Habitat Stewardship Program which provided funding for the Hamilton naturalists Clubâ€™s initiative!

Planting milkweed seeds in our garden is one way to keep these beautiful butterflies around!
