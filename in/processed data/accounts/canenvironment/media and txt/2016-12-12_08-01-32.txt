“Hi there, we’re two brand new sanderling #sandpipers checking in from the Great White North. We may only be a few hours old, but we are ready to go! Don’t worry, mom and dad are close by as we get our vitals taken. But first, we’ll get a few leg bands that will help track our progress as we migrate south for the #winter. Soon we’ll be soaking up the sun ☀️on the Florida coast. You may have met our famous cousin, #PixarPiper? Her plumage is a little different from ours, but that’s because we need to blend into the arctic tundra to keep predators at bay. We can’t wait to grow into those beautiful silvery feathers, and to snack on some yummy clams on our own to a sunny beach. Surf’s up!🏄🏽”
