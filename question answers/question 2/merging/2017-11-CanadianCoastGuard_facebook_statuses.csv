A total of 14 students and staff were divided into three groups and sent to various work stations onboard the icebreaker. They learned about anchoring operations and how a windlass works. They were briefed on launching lifeboats during rescue operations; and about the safe operation of deck machinery including mooring and towing winches. As well, they learned how to steer a large vessel while underway as they pulled up the anchor and sailed in Frobisher Bay for a few hours. The enthusiastic and supportive crew were also able to describe shipboard life and share their experiences working with the Coast Guard.
