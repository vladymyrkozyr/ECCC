They will then be moving to the land near Tree River, Back-Hermann River and finally Igloolik.\n\nThe Program for Regional and International Shorebird Monitoring (PRISM) was designed by biologists and researchers from the Canadian and United States Governments (Canadian Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) to address concerns about shorebird population declines first noted on migration surveys.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#ArcticShoreBirdMonitoringProgram  #Kugluktuk #ArcticPrism #CanadianWildlifeService #ArcticScience #ArcticAdventures #BiologistOfInstagram #Nunavut #Shorebird #Shorebirds #Canada #NPSW #WithNature #EnvironmentCanada",
