Experience the solitude of the wide-open plain as the prairie wind ripples a sea of grasses beneath the clear blue sky. Grasslands National Park is one of the few remaining natural grasslands in North America, a testament to the prairies as they existed for millennia before they were turned under by the settlersâ€™ plough.
Here visitors really can watch the buffalo roam, the deer and the antelope play. Once near extinction, the plains bison, swift fox and black-footed ferret have been carefully re-introduced to their natural habitat. ðŸ“· by @Todd_Mintz_photography
