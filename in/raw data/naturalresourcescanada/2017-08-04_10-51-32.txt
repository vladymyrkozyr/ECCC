Student research assistants Nicolas Piette-Lauziere and Zoik Brault are in the field at the edge of Cape Breton Highlands National Park. They are proudly displaying their #GSC175 commemorative t-shirts! 
Over the last month, Nicolas and Zoik have been mapping a fault zone on Cape Breton Island that separates rocks with different geological histories on either side. By studying the fault zone in the field, and collecting samples to study in the lab, Nicolas hopes to discover when and why it formed, and how it may have created a pathway for magma deep in the Earthâ€™s crust to rise and form granite.
