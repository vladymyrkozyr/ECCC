    "caption": "During the 2017 breeding season, scientists with Canadian Wildlife Service and @ParksCanada counted a record 63 whooping crane chicks in and around Wood Buffalo National Park \u2013 a substantial and encouraging increase over the previous record of 49 in 2006.  Monitoring efforts now switch from boreal breeding areas to Saskatchewan\u2019s parkland and prairie regions, where migrating whooping cranes stop for up to six weeks before continuing their journey to wintering grounds along the Texas Gulf Coast.  We ask that anyone observing this endangered species to call the Whooping Crane Hotline at (306) 975-5595 \ud83d\udcf8: John Conkin .\n.\n.\n.\n#SpeciesAtRisk #MigratoryBirds #BirdMonitoring #CanadianWildlifeService #WhoopingCrane #Saskatchewan #InstaBirds",
