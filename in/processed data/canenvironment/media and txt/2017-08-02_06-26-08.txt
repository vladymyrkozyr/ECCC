C3 Fauna: Did you know the Arctic is home to thousands of seabirds, who divide their time between the ocean, and steep rocky cliffs? We were lucky enough to see thick billed murres up close yesterday. Murres can dive over 200 meters deep in search of food and will fly 30 to 50 miles away from the island on their foraging flights. Have you ever seen one?
