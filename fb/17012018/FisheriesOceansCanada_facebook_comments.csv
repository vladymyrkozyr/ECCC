Here is the report: http://www.cwhc-rcsf.ca/right_whales.php

Notable points:

Pg. 27: ""There are no indications that vessel traffic in 2017 was significantly different than 2016 or previous years nor that pattern of use deviated from previously observed.""

Pg. 16: ""... involvement of an infectious disease in this mortality event is unlikely ...""

UNLIKELY? That is CLEARLY an opinion.

Pg. 16: ""Trauma caused by human interaction, particularly vessel collision, has been a major cause of mortality in the population of North Atlantic right whales (Laist et al. 2001; Moore et al. 2004). Campbell-Malone et al. (2008).""

These sources were PRIOR to Zika and Wolbachia-infected Aedes releases.

Can we not look at the phylogenetics of Zika, a novel pathogen, for a moment? 

Whales have suffered West Nile virus and St. Louis encephalitis viruses and Zika shares this clade with over 97 percent support. Source: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01248/full

N.A. right whales have been spotted as far south as the Bahamas and Mexico. They often have mouth abrasions. There are multiple ways Zika and/or Wolbachia could be infecting them. Mosquito bites are merely ONE way.

Are we going to foolishly cling to Hertig's 1936 results on mice and chicken embryos? Or, are we going to acknowledge and devote resources to testing vertebrates (including humans) for the presence of Wolbachia?

Because here are facts that are being willfully ignored:

The direct effect of Wolbachia can either impede or promote the pathogen's replication and survival (Zug and Hammerstein, 2015). Examples of neutral or pro-pathogenic effect of Wolbachia include: Brugia pahangi (Dutton and Sinkins, 2005); Japanese encephalitis (JE) Virus (Tsai et al., 2006); Drosophila C Virus (Osborne et al., 2009); and Plasmodium gallinaceum (Baton et al., 2013).

Wolbachia Enhances West Nile Virus (WNV) Infection in the Mosquito Culex tarsalis: http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0002965

Zika Virus in Salivary Glands of Five Different Species of Wild-Caught Mosquitoes from Mexico: http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/19/151951

Both Wolbachia and Zika are maternally inherited. This reproductive parasite (Wolbachia) and the Zika virus are in the eggs and larvae of mosquitoes which copepods and krill feed on. 

Some species only partially eat Aedes larvae causing their contents to spill out into sea water.

Over 28,000 cases of Zika were reported in Puerto Rico as of Oct. 26th, 2016. The waters surrounding many islands in the Caribbean are obviously teeming with Zika-infected Aedes and Culex mosquitoes, eggs, and larvae. 

Testing for Zika should be a no-brainer to any seasoned pathologist. 

The ONLY conclusion that can solidly be drawn from this pathology report: TWO whales out of 15 died from entanglement. The four or five attributed to blunt trauma based on ""severe internal bleeding"" could also be caused by infections or bleeding in transport or even foul play. 

When I asked Dr. Daoust about Zika, WNV, SLEV, and Wolbachia, he replied that these whales were in various states of decomposition, downplayed the likelihood of a mosquito biting them, and therefore these were not even considered or tested for.

My own data (based on organic visits to a reference-based article I wrote about Zika in men) confirmed my worst fears:

Overnight-active Culex spp. are probably responsible for the worst manifestations of the Zika. And Wolbachia is likely providing the mode of transportation to the gonads, heart, CNS, optic lobe, and retina. Zika (in men) has moved further north, into New York, the U.K. and Canada.

Technically salmon and rainbow and brown trout are all invasive in great lakes yet they spawned a multi billion dollar a year fishery and commercial fishery. Gobies which are invasive to great lakes used to be bad news...however eapecially in lake huron where we lost our alewives and consequncly 90% of our chinook salmon due to invasive musels filtering out the plankton and nutrients alewives needed to live...the gobies invaded...turns out the gobies find the mussels a delicasy!!! Inturn the lake trout and coho and browns and rainbow learned to adapt to gobies here and all species except the chinook (who r to picky and refuse to adapt to ensure there species) are thriving and then some on the gobies. So some invasives can actually benefit the existing ecosystem....

But snakeheads....ur right there so aggresive there like pike on steroids. U shud see there teeth! And there fast jaw clamp! If snakeheads got into great lakes all fish wud be in peril as theyd eat them! Lol",2017-11-14 02:01:56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Waste is a terrible thing.  The fishing I 5hink you may be talking about with gill nets not being picked up by commercial fisherman.      I know from personal experience that it is not easy in a 25, 30 or 40-foot steel boat to go back out sometimes to pull nets because of weather conditions on the lake.  We've had a couple incidents on Lake Superior that made the local news where nets were left and drifted...but it was weather related.  The nets weren't abandoned...just unable to be retrieved immediately because of weather.  I am sure there may be some that will perhaps play the state..but the worldview I grew up with is..don't take more than you need and you share with the community...for example at a feast or pow wow.  There are indigenous peoples who do have commercial fishing licenses...(For example, my family were commercial fisherman and followed the fish from Duck Island, off Manitoulin and as far as Michepicoten.)   I don't believe fishermen would willingly leave nets unless there is no safe way to retrieve them.

move to ""bait and switch"" the current pressure on fish farms and the
pressure from First Nations because of favouring an essentially
unregulated sport fishing industry. It has clearly incited racist
comments. Have we not gotten beyond this with DFO?

For a starter, all members of pre-Confederate Douglas Treaty Nations
have a guaranteed right to ""fish as formerly"" including fishing and
selling. Modern treaties (Nisga'a, Tsawwassen, Tla'Amin for example)
have guaranteed harvesting rights that go well beyond the conventional
""Food, Social and Ceremonial"" (FSC) fishing limitations. And to
despite multiple challenges, the federal Supreme Court has stated
clearly through the Nuu-Chah-Nulth case that Canada's fishing regime
(yes, that's DFO) infringes on the Aboriginal right to fish and SELL
fish. This has huge implications for all Aboriginal fishing rights
under s.35 of the Constitution. Keep in mind treaty rights to fish and
sell (those articulated in the treaties themselves) are separate from
the Aboriginal rights to fish and sell (the overarching rights that
are Constitutionally protected under s.35). Many Nations have both and
this only strengthens and reinforces their right to sell fish.
Treaties do not extinguish Aboriginal rights, ever. For the record,
neither fish farm rights nor sport fishing rights have precedence over
First Nations fishing rights. Sigh. It gets rather exhausting going
over this again and again.

So we now have DFO posting on their website information that is not
correct, incites continued racist stereotypes and is likely a ploy to
divert the pressure and attention they are having to deal with
regarding the fish farms and accommodation of sport fishing rights
over First Nations fishing rights. Nice.

For all First Nations who can show that the exchange of fish for money
or other goods, on a commercial basis, formed an integral part of
their distinctive culture, any federal fishery regulations that
restrict an aboriginal right to fish, will likely be struck down in
court. The courts of Canada have promised that to the First Nations.
So what is DFO doing here?",2017-09-12 19:09:32,12,10,2,0,0,0,0,0

Than its followed up by the equivalent from the opposing side.  So my opinion is changed. I'm curious to know where to see fact.. not a specific ruling on some white guy poaching or some chief charged with selling etc.. or any proposed revision of ruling from either side.

Let me do it in sort of the same order of ""weight"" as I laid out....first, have a read of the SCC Claxton case (1989) that articulates the Douglas Treaty to ""fish as formerly""...then have a look at the Chartrand case of 2015 about the SCC articulation of how Canada and BC have breached those treaties and how powerful the pre-Confederate treaties are... then have a read of the actual modern treaties here in BC (take your pick but two good ones to look at are Tla'Amin and Tsawwassen)...then settle in for a read of the fundamental cases that have defined Aboriginal fishing rights...actually, save yourself a bit of time and just stick to those cases that have been decided in the Supreme Court, our highest court....Sparrow (1990)...Van Der Peet (1996)...Smokehouse (1996)...Gladstone (1996)...and then spend some time with the judges comments on the Ahousaht case which was decided in 2009 but even after huge federal (read: DFO) effort to appeal this, the courts upheld the original decision of 2009. The truth is, I appreciate when people like yourself ask for evidence and want to do their own research. Just imagine how we could actually work together if people came to these issues with their eyes wide open.

I'm not about to argue Aboriginal Rights here, much has been written and said on that issue that not only the courts recognize as being valid but so does our government. The only rules that matter here are those that were created and self imposed on Aboriginal people by Aboriginal people, for millennia and those rules, we are now figuring out, worked better than the rules created by our fathers and forefathers imposed on Indigenous people when we came over and took over their land and resources with no consultation or compensation. Imagine an immigrant coming to your house and land and telling you that you have to move, that you will live under their law and that you will be limited on how you can support yourself and your family...... I don't believe you'd roll over and take this, nor do I think you wouldn't fight till your death to prevent this from happening to you and your community, yet that is exactly what Europeans did to the North American Indigenous people that occupied what we call ""America"" for thousands of years. Before you start talking about ""equality"", perhaps we should redress the wrongs committed against Aboriginal people for over 300 years now and, never forget that the rules you speak of were in fact imposed, without agreement, against Aboriginal by non-Aboriginal invaders... why in the hell should they continue to be forced to play by those ""rules"".... think about that and put yourself in those shoes for a minute.

What DFO wants is no one being  allowed to touch any live food source with out it being a business deal that the govt profits off of. If you can't afford to buy it and it hasn't been taxed it's hands off.  That is not equality nor is it humane. Poor hungry people will be fined and possibly jailed for hunting or fishing because they don't have a license. Rich people can buy boats and licenses and catch tonnes to make a living...

Marshall agreements that were signed by the majority of band council chiefs throughout our seven Districts when the Supreme Court ruling came out is the reason why D.F.O. Is talking tough on our fishermen selling lobster when fishing under communal licenses. Once you take their money, then you accept their jurisdiction with it too and give yours up, plain and simple, they should never have signed those agreements with D.F.O., all they were was to limit our access to the commercial fisheries. The Supreme Court of Canada ruling in Donald Marshalls case clearly stated that all Mi'gmaq had a right to earn a modest living from the commercial fishery, all not a few, when the band councils signed those agreements, they accepted the handful of licenses that came with these restrictive agreements and their law that came with these agreements. I told our band council in 2000 or so at that time not sign them because the only people that will benefit will be the non native fishermen who were selling their licenses and their rotting boats and fishing equipment to our people, and that's exactly what happened, some of the boats that were bought by the band council never saw water because they were not sea worthy and would have sunk, and to think D.F.O. Knew about these unfit boat deals and didn't stop them. We could have had china invest in our own commercial fishery at that time and were to invest their money because they saw the extra aboriginal commercial fishery quotas in which they could buy from us. I had in 1997 hired a Chinese business woman from B.C. go to china and secure the necessary agreements in principle that would have seen the Chinese invest in buying new boats, financing fish plants throughout our Districts and shared that with the chief and council at that time, they didn't want to hear of it, the chief and his executive director at that time were tripping over their feet running down the band council steps to high tail it to Moncton or Fredericton to sign the D.F.O agreements, now 17 years later these D.F.O. Agreements are coming back to haunt the fishermen, so of course the Feds will say, ""a deal is a deal"" you  took the money and we take control, fair and square.",2017-09-13 20:03:55,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

The Chief involved of this legal challenge said this decision would be a good precedent for the eastern Nations to follow. The decision was never challenged by the feds and so stands as part of the law. The decision also gave the Nation and DFO 2 years to develop an agreement on how this would be implemented. DFO has also been told that they cannot interfere with Natives fisheries without notification of intent to do so and show just cause for doing so. C&C need to keep up to date on what is happening to fisheries across this country and start protecting the fisheries here in Listuguj, protecting the right to fish and those would want to exercise that right. The SCoBC also recently said that if fisheries are to be limited for conservation purposes, the Aboriginal fisheries would get the quotas available before White fisheries.

First they say that they just want to inform you of changes, and then they go back and implant their regulations often most times limiting or restricting our fishery in some way, and when we question how they can do that, they say you were consulted. The band councils never learn, taking that easy money means there's a price to pay for dealing with the devil, our 7th District Tribal council in the near future will be developing our own harvesting laws in fishery and other resource harvesting outside of the Indian act band council boundaries where our ancestral original governing system can assert its jurisdiction, as long as the harvesting is done in a responsible manner, respecting conservation, as we did with our Salmon Fishery law adopted in the early 90s. We are not bound by the Indian act and its restrictive legislation, we assert our authority and jurisdiction through using aboriginal title and that our District lands are still unceded Mi'gmaq Indian lands, something that the band councils should be doing instead of negotiating with Canada, and Quebec in their extinguishment and surrender land claims negotiations. Many of our people do not know that these MMS land claims and self government negotiations with Canada and Quebec are in the agreement in principle stage, the next step is the final stage, they haven't even show us what they have been secretly negotiating behind closed doors and the agreement in principle document, ask your council members to provide this document. As political representatives of our treaty rights and our collective lands they should have access to these documents, they cannot claim that they do not know, it's their job and fiduciary responsibility to know how our treaty rights and our collective titles to our lands are being used in these negotiations and are being done so without ever directly asking for our consent. We asked the former chief Scott Martin and his councillors to provide these documents in a letter sent sent to them by our Tribal council in 2016,but they refused and ignored our request, he and other councillors are no longer in power now because of their unwillingness to be open and honest about how our treaty rights and collective land tiles are being used as commodities to be sold to Canada and Quebec. Chief Darcy Gray and some of the new councillors that that got elected in 2016 promised open accountability if they got elected at several of our Tribal council meetings they attended looking for our support, we are still waiting for that open accountability, it seems that they got swallowed up by the Indian act beast as one elder used to use that phrase when newly elected councillors got the taste of the fringe benefits that came with being a councillor. They forgot who put them there, and how elections come around on a dime, and people don't forget their actions during their terms.",2017-09-14 09:29:27,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

In 1996, the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the Heiltsuk right to harvest and sell SOK for trade and commercial purposes, after William and Donald Gladstone successfully defended Fisheries Act charges for harvesting and selling SOK without a commercial licence. The Court held that the Heiltsuk SOK commercial right is second only to conservation and takes priority over all other user groups including commercial fishers. Prior to this affirmation, Canada had fought and denied the existence of this commercial right through five levels of court. This year as Canada commemorates its 150 year existence  as nation state,  we reflect on the 14,000 plus years Heiltsuk have maintained this ongoing relationship involving  commerce and trade from  the sea and it resources. we have and will continue to define our relationship with our aquatic environment according to our laws.

So the next year I grew more and then more and then more because the money was good, it helped me out. Soon other people began to the same and we all had extra money.  People were coming from everywhere to buy them. One day the government said I couldn't sell anymore but people still came so I continued with what I was doing because I knew there were enough farms selling illegal tomatoes that they couldn't get to me for a long time.

But have you ever been to the Fraser River or any of the major BC Salmon rivers?  The illegal fishing is pretty hard to miss, as is the outrageous and largely unregulated amount of fish that are taken under the guise of native food fish.  Its utterly sickening to me how many non natives buy illegal native fish.  Which by the way was the reason and point in my original post.  Ultimately its the fact that there are so many willing buyers thats the heart of the problem.

Nevertheless, i am in the sports fishing industry.  I am directly aware of the fact that the non native licence holders pay real aftertax money for those licenses, and the non residents pay thru the nose.  But arguably more importantly, there are ample and fairly accurate catch statistics... and most importantly, the $$ multiplier effect on our economy is massive per angler day.

I deal with dfo regularly.  They are ridiculously, embarrassingly understaffed. Its such shameful failure of our government, along with the virtual absence of money directed to salmon restocking and enhancement.
 But i challenge you ask 50 DFO officere  what the number one problem is that they face on an ongoing basis, and without question 100% of them will tell you its illegal native fishing,  basically harvests far beyond what is needed for food fish thats absolutely intended for sale on the black market....and the fact that they are largely powerless to do anything about it.

I am not remotely anti-native,  in fact quite the opposite.....but to suggest that an Ottawa stat canada stat even begins to capture the actual percentage of the fishery harvested both legally and illegally by FN is simply naive",2017-09-18 23:34:24,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

What i do know , is there are many people fishing threatened runs, often harvesting recklessly without regard for the resource and the implications and selling ""illegally""  .  This is often happenning while DFO/enforcement are preventing both the ""official"" commercial and sport fishing industries from fishing at all,  in the interest of stock preservation.   This harvesting and selling of catch is  often done under the guise of ""food fish rights"" when its really a secretive underground commercial enterprise.  I have to think its fairly easy to see why there is some resentment around that isnt there even as a FN member?

I think you would be hard pressed to find many Canadians who have a problem with respecting overall native rights to harvest natural resources.  Despite the fact that a card carrying FN Canadian ends up with far broader rights than an non FN fellow Cdn.  The problem arises when harvesting is done under the guise of food fish rights to support a commercial enterprise to the benefit of a handful of individuals who feel the laws dont apply to them,  all while they enjoy more than their share of what our tax paying nation provides .  Its just hard not to see it as  a little hypocritical and i would hope that there are many FN members who would think that such activity doesnt represent their honour well.",2017-09-21 16:43:47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I know where this Institute is as are all the Institutes that have any doings with the Fishery. They are NOT in Newfoundland and Labrador despite the fact a big percentage of the fish comes from our jurisdictional waters. I, like all Newfoundlanders and Labradorians, am not too impressed with how the fish resource that we brought into Canada in 1949 has been treated and delved out for others, not only in Canada but all over the World by DFO, while the inshore fishers of Newfoundland and Labrador have been treated horribly with a few thousand pounds, as with Cod 3000 lbs of it to create a miserly economy for themselves, the Fishermen were getting 49 cents per pound.  If you know anything about the economy of our province of NL we are told by some Ottawa personnel that we are on the verge of bankruptcy.

In 1949 when Newfoundland and Labrador became the 10th province of Canada, it brought with it a humungous load of wonderful natural resources, including a land mass 3 times the size of the other 3 Atlantic Provinces, hundreds of thousands of square kilometres of the Atlantic Ocean waters, the Air Space above, the Fish Resource, a large Hydroelectricity Resource, Minerals  of all types including Iron Ore, Nickel Ore, Gold, other ores, Oil and we have provided the rest of Canada with our Human Resource.  All of these resources brought Ottawa an enormous amount of revenue.

We are deemed to be a ‚Äúhave‚Äù  province but yet we have none of our raw natural resources working for us and the only way our provincial government knows how to raise revenue, it appears, is to tax our people to death all the while giving away our natural resources in the raw state so that others can build smelting, processing and manufacturing economies.  

We in NL, are not on the receiving end of equalization payments as we are deemed to be NOT eligible.  We have the Muskrat Falls Hydroelectric Project presently ongoing which when completed, we are told, will make the citizens of our province completely destitute when it comes on stream, as the province of Nova Scotia will be the beneficiary at 4 cents per kilowatt hour of that energy, while our NL citizens will have to pay up to 27 cents per kilowatt hour almost 7 times what Nova Scotians will be paying.

In 1949 when Canada succeeded in getting the province of NL as the 10th province after two referenda were held, Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent, in a speech to his Canadian subjects, said that getting the province of NL into the Canadian Federation was an 80 year dream of Canadians that began In 1867 when the Canadian Federation was formed.

Somebody in the Ottawa Federal Government needs to turn their eyes and ears and do a study to figure out how a province with so many great natural resources and such a wonderful natural location turned out to be destitute.  The attention needs be turned to what can be done to restore our province to the great economic position it should have been enjoying since 1949 given our great location and our great natural resource base.
