This is Charlene, everyoneâ€™s favourite summer student! 
Charlene is starting an M.Sc. degree in geology this fall, so this expedition will give her some great hands-on experience in remote settings while learning more about economic geology. 
Charlene will be taking detailed measurements on drill core samples, assisting with digital data management, helping manage the camp and contributing ideas to the deposit models.
