Just outside the city of Edmonton is a hidden gem called Bunchberry Meadows. This forest provides habitat for all sorts of amazing species â€“ from moose to owls to salamanders!

We are proud to announce that this forest will be conserved through our Ecological Gifts Program and the Natural Areas Conservation Program.

Protecting this land will give Edmontonians the opportunity to share this space with their family for generations to come. .
