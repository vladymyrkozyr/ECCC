“Last summer I travelled with Adventure Canada to the Prince Leopold Island Migratory Bird Sanctuary in Lancaster Sound, Nunavut.  Because of the tight schedule of the ship our only opportunity to get out in Zodiacs below the seabird cliffs was at 6:30 before breakfast but despite this and a biting cold wind, about 80 passengers took part and all were thrilled by the experience!” – Garry, CWS Crew
