Shorebirds look completely different in the winter \u2013 so Anthony is used to identifying them more from their shape and sound than when they are in their breeding plumage in the arctic and are easier to identify. Arctic-breeding shorebirds spend most of their life cycle outside Canada, so it is fantastic when we get to cooperate with our international colleagues. In this photo, the twin otter is loaded up and the survey team is about to head to the tundra!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#NationalVolunteerWeek2017 #NationalVolunteerWeek #Volunteering #SkilledVolunteers #CitizenScientists #ClosetBirdNerds #CenterForConservationBiology #ArcticShorebirdMonitoringProgram #CanadianWildlifeService #MigratoryBirds #CanadianVolunteers #InternationalVolunteers #MigratoryConnectivity #KendallIsland #FieldWork", "likes": 46, "shortcode": "BTXJbJ9FeHe", "date": "2017-04-26T13:17:37", "caption_mentions": [], "is_video": false, "id": "2017-04-26_13-17-37", "caption_hashtags": ["nationalvolunteerweek2017", "nationalvolunteerweek", "volunteering", "skilledvolunteers", "citizenscientists", "closetbirdnerds", "centerforconservationbiology", "arcticshorebirdmonitoringprogr", "canadianwildlifeservice", "migratorybirds", "canadianvolunteers", "internationalvolunteers", "migratoryconnectivity", "kendallisland", "fieldwork"], "owner_id": 3913900802}, {"mediaid": 1502381055805897905, "owner_username": "canenvironment", "url": "https://instagram.fyvr3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b72035e1216d361417d3006b4f3fa739/5AF0D007/t51.2885-15/e35/24838662_149940085649384_7515482749776429056_n.jpg", "tagged_users": [], "comments": 7, "typename": "GraphImage", "caption": "National Volunteer Week is a special time to recognize all the people who donate their time to make our work possible.

Their work focuses on conserving and protecting seabirds, some of which are at-risk. Recently an apparently injured Northern Fulmar seabird was found on an offshore support vessel near Newfoundland and Labrador. The fulmar features large black eyes and a striking short, tube-like beak and resembles a gull; however it is actually related to the albatross and shearwater. It breeds in a few dozen scattered locations off Alaska and Canada, but is more abundant in the northeast Atlantic. \nOnce the bird was delivered to the Canadian Wildlife Service lab, Sabina and Regina examined it, determined that it wasn\u2019t injured, and decided it was ready for release. They took it to Witless Bay where a small colony of other fulmars breeds on three islands in the area. They watched the bird drink and vigorously bathe until it swam out of range toward the mouth of the bay.  We\u2019re excited about this happy ending!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#CanadianWildlifeService #Conservation #Wildlife #Fieldwork #Fulmar #NorthernFulmar #SeaBirds #BiologistsOfInstagram #Biologist #Biologists #BirdLovers #BirdNerds #InstaBird #InstaBirds #CanEnvironment #EnvironmentCanada", "likes": 83, "shortcode": "BWI2h9dFvZK", "date": "2017-07-04T13:37:20", "caption_mentions": [], "is_video": false, "id": "2017-07-04_13-37-20", "caption_hashtags": ["canadianwildlifeservice", "conservation", "wildlife", "fieldwork", "fulmar", "northernfulmar", "seabirds", "biologistsofinstagram", "biologist", "biologists", "birdlovers", "birdnerds", "instabird", "instabirds", "canenvironment", "environmentcanada"], "owner_id": 3913900802}, {"mediaid": 1552489241858307534, "owner_username": "canenvironment", "url": "https://instagram.fyvr3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/fa4ce8528971cb48f762dfe9b0559a50/5AE5C2EE/t51.2885-15/e35/25009438_193256671250944_5176318121559982080_n.jpg", "tagged_users": [], "comments": 1, "typename": "GraphSidecar", "caption": "How do you tag a snail?

This project is part of a tri-national collaboration between Canada, the USA, and Mexico, with the goal of determining where and when the bird is most limited: on the breeding grounds in Canada and the USA, or the wintering grounds in Mexico. To monitor survival, we are deploying tiny Very High Frequency (VHF) transmitters in Alberta, while our partners at the Bird Conservancy of the Rockies deploy transmitters in Montana, North Dakota and Mexico. .\n.\n.\n#NativeGrasslands #GrasslandBirds #CanadianWildlifeService #Koperlab #BirdMonitoring #InstaBirds #Partnership #Biologists #Fieldwork #EnvironmentCanada #EnvironmentCan", "likes": 120, "shortcode": "BdvGbqZlBVo", "date": "2018-01-09T08:47:11", "caption_mentions": [], "is_video": false, "id": "2018-01-09_08-47-11", "caption_hashtags": ["nativegrasslands", "grasslandbirds", "canadianwildlifeservice", "koperlab", "birdmonitoring", "instabirds", "partnership", "biologists", "fieldwork", "environmentcanada", "environmentcan"], "owner_id": 3913900802}, {"mediaid": 1690689605639351296, "owner_username": "canenvironment", "url": "https://instagram.fyvr3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e4a0830bae3e607e577e01a0f7972334/5AD8A952/t51.2885-15/e35/26180984_317780165375479_3088416257049886720_n.jpg", "tagged_users": [], "comments": 0, "typename": "GraphSidecar", "caption": "Would you believe these pictures were taken back to back? \nOne of our scientists working at the Eureka Weather Station in Eureka, Nunavut, went for a morning walk.
