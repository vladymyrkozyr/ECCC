#COOLSCIENTISTALERT!
One of our landscape ecologists studies windbreaks and hedgerows which provide important habitat for pollinators üêù including native Canadian bee species. Her two-year project allows us to have baseline data to see if, how, and where bee species are affected. This is long-term data is especially important in the context of climate change and land-use modification.
