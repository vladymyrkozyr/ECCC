Breathe in the beauty and remember that by keeping our planet healthy, we keep ourselves healthy too.\n\nEven as scientists discover new species (estimates suggest millions remain unknown), it is clear that our biodiversity is under threat \u2013 from competing land uses, pollution, population growth and human activities.\n\nWe\u2019re working with partners to conserve our biodiversity.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nWorldEnvironmentDay #WithNature #Canada #EnvironmentCanada #Wildlifeconservation #ConservationWork #FieldWork #Canada150 #WEDCan #Biodiversity",
