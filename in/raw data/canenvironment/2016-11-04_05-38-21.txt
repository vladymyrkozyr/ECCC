Good news comes on Friday! 🙌🏽 The Randle Reef Sediment Remediation Project is cleaning up Hamilton Harbour. Yay clean water! The engineered containment facility (or ECF) pictured here acts like a box that will store the yuckiest of sediment. When the $138.9 million project is complete in 2022, it will make the water cleaner for the fish 🐟 & us to enjoy, and bring jobs and tourism to the local community. Hooray!!!!! 🎉 📷: Bermingham Foundation Solutions
