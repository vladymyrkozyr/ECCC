    "caption": "Meet our Conservation Biologists Karen and Julie and Wildlife Enforcement Officer Ryan. They\u2019re at Halifax\u2019s McNabs Island, home to one of Nova Scotia\u2019s biggest barn swallow colonies. Although barn swallows are one of the world\u2019s most widespread and common land bird species, populations in Canada have declined by 75% since the 1970s. Karen and her colleagues are busy carefully checking up on breeding and nesting barn swallows, making sure these aerial insectivores are able to breed and raise their babies undisturbed by Island visitors.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#Conservation #McnabsIsland #Halifax #CanadianWildlifeService #CanadianWildlife #FieldWork #EnvironmentCanada #Enforcement #WildlifeOfficer #BirdNerds #BiologistsOfInstagram #WithNature",
