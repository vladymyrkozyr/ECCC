The airline rebooked us 5 days later because that was their only flight which had availability. Although there was availability on their partner flight, they would not book us on another airline. We could not wait for 5 days to return home, as a result, we purchased new flights. We tried to work with the airline to receive a refund but they refused to offer any compensation. Consequently, we turned to the Canadian Transportation Agency for assistance. Their service was amazing- very thorough, very comprehensive and very attentive. The first contact explained the passenger tariff and our rights as passengers. We took the next step and asked CTA to mediate on our behalf, which fortunately turned out to be a successful exercise. We were very impressed with the support we received and the professionalism of the staff at CTA. It is sad that the state of airline travel in Canada requires an agency such as the CTA but it is reassuring to know that they are there to help ensure passenger rights are met.""
