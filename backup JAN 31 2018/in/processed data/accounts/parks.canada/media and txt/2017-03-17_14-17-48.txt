Happy St. Patrick’s Day! ☘️ ☘️☘️ In the 19th century, an increasing stream of people was leaving Europe to rebuild their lives in North America. Around 1830, an average of 30,000 immigrants arrived annually in the City of Québec, and approximately two-thirds of these newcomers were from Ireland. In order to help control the spread of the diseases, the quarantine station at Grosse Île was established in 1832 and operated until its closure in 1937. You will be touched by the story of Grosse Île, a witness to both human tragedy and exceptional dedication.
