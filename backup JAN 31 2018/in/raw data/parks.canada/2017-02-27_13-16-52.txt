Happy #InternationalPolarBearDay! This photo from @daisygilardini was taken in Wapusk National Park, which protects one of the largest polar bear maternity denning areas in the world. We are committed to the protection of these majestic, curious and agile creatures, the largest land carnivores in North America.
