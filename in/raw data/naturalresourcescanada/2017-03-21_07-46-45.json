Forests enrich the lives of all Canadians, offer a place of sanctuary and recreation and are fundamental to the cultural and spiritual values of Indigenous peoples. Forests provide habitat for wildlife, moderate climate and filter air and water. \nOn International Day of Forests, March 21, take a moment to Celebrate Canada\u2019s forests. \n#IntForestDay #CDNForests #Wildlife #Forest",
