Do you recognize this geodesic dome that became an icon of the Montréal landscape in 1967? Do you know what it’s used for now? The Biosphere is the only environment museum in North America! If you find yourself in Montréal this summer, take the opportunity to visit the Museum! We have organized several new exhibitions to celebrate the 375th anniversary of Montréal, the 150th anniversary of Canada, and the 50th anniversary of Expo 67.
