Canadian wetlands provide enormous benefits to people by protecting against floods, improving water quality and water supply, controlling erosion and supporting a variety of recreational activities. 

Although the importance of wetlands is being recognized more and more; many of Canada’s wetlands in settled areas have been lost, and Canada continues to lose these important habitats – both naturally and because of human-related activities.

The National Wetland Conservation Fund (NWCF) supports organizations and communities across Canada to participate actively in the restoration and enhancement of degraded wetlands. For example, an NWCF project led by Ducks Unlimited Canada enhanced 140 hectares of wetland habitat throughout N.B., N.S. and P.E.I.

Air carriers have different policies regarding the carriage of pets. While some may accept pets as checked baggage or allow them to travel within the cabin with their owners, others may not. Before reserving space for your pet on your flights, ask your air carrier about its pet policy. Also contact the embassy or consulate of your destination country for specific restrictions, as well as the vaccinations and documentation required for pets entering other countries.
