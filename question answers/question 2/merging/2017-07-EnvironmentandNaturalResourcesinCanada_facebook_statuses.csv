It is a bird parasite that affects the upper digestive tract of birds, limiting their ability to swallow and keep their food down. 

Although bird feeders and baths make it easier for us to watch birds in their natural habitat, they can be harmful during an outbreak. You can help slow down the spread of Trichomonosis by removing bird feeders and baths and following  these simple steps: 

BIRD FEEDERS AND BATHS
1) Take down your bird feeders and bird baths. During the summer, there is enough natural food available, so there is no need to worry. 
2) Wash them thoroughly with a weak bleach solution (5% sodium hypochlorite).
3) Dispose of any wet or exposed feed left around your bird feeders and baths.
4) Refrain from putting them back in your yard until the cooler temperatures in the Fall.
