Two Arctic Wolves relaxing after a feast near Eureka Weather Station, Nunavut. “One day as I was outside and driving up near the dump outside of the station I came across these two wolves off of the runway relaxing after a meal. Seeing the stain in the fur on the one wolf was truly amazing.” – Braden, MSC crew
