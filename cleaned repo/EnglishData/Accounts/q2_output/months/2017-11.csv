On Wednesday, November 8th, the NFMTC Bridge Watch Rating class was enthusiastically welcomed aboard CCGS Henry Larsen by Captain MacDonald and his crew. A total of 14 students and staff were divided into three groups and sent to various work stations onboard the icebreaker. They learned about anchoring operations and how a windlass works. They were briefed on launching lifeboats during rescue operations; and about the safe operation of deck machinery including mooring and towing winches. As well, they learned how to steer a large vessel while underway as they pulled up the anchor and sailed in Frobisher Bay for a few hours. The enthusiastic and supportive crew were also able to describe shipboard life and share their experiences working with the Coast Guard. 
 
Captain Phil Hillier, NFMTC, noted that for many students, being on board a vessel of this size was a first for most and that being able not only see how the ship operates but also to actually have hands-on experience was very important in supplementing what is taught at the marine college. Captain Hillier was confident that this experience will motivate the students to want to further a career in the marine industry.","Weeks of planning paid off for the Nunavut Fisheries and Marine Training Consortium, NFMTC, in Iqaluit and the Canadian Coast Guard.

ANSWER:
Oceans, forests and wetlands that take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere are called carbon sinks.
Carbon sinks such as oceans, forests and wetlands remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by absorbing it like a sponge.
