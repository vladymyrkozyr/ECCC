Why? Because data and connected technology enable: 
• Openness
When communities make their data truly accessible, usable and barrier-free, their decision-making processes become transparent, empowering citizens and strengthening the relationship between residents and public organizations.
• Integration
Data and connected technology empower communities to break down silos that exist within local governments and public organizations. 
• Transferability
When tools and technological approaches are open-source, transparent and standardized, they can be used by communities across the country, no matter their size or capacity.

But only vehicles weighing less than 3,000 kg could use the bridge; requiring 10-minute detours for emergency services and residents with heavier vehicles.
Thanks to a $2.9 million grant from the federal Gas Tax Fund, replacing the bridge with something more practical went from dream to reality.
Last month the entire community came out to celebrate the opening of the new Sugarloaf Bridge.
And what better way to welcome the new structure than by parading a fleet of heavy-weight vehicles across for the first time!

But what’s a pier cap? Well, it is the massive, W-shaped steel structure that the bridge’s three traffic corridors will rest on. 

As you can imagine, installation of this 261-ton giant is quite a feat. To lift each half-cap piece, two cranes are used to position it in the air vertically, and precisely set it onto the legs so that a second piece can be joined to it in exactly the same way.

The connection in the centre needs to be made with pinpoint accuracy to ensure the pier cap is solid and able to fully carry out its function.

Esther graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in architecture in 1920, becoming the first woman to do so anywhere in Canada. Her passion for design inspired a legacy of projects across the country. 

From the interior design of the former Eaton’s department store in Toronto, to the conception of the Edmonton public library, to the design of various residential buildings in Victoria, B.C., her extensive resume has diversified Canadian architectural design and paved the way for other women to do the same.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TransportandInfrastructureinCanada/photos/a.10151569797817975.1073741825.401846167974/10154711826952975/?type=3,2016-10-20 13:31:14,9,0,1,9,0,0,0,0,0,0
