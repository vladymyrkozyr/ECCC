Here we are, four biologists (two in front, one way in the back, and yours truly behind the camera), installing a fence through a small tree-lined wetland at the Last Mountain Lake National Wildlife Area (NWA), Saskatchewan.🛠 We need fences like this one to keep our local “vegetation managers”(🐄) from wandering off the NWA and onto the roads and neighbouring properties. They munch away to keep our grasslands healthy!  It took a lot of elbow grease to install this 3.2-km fence. We worked on it in our spare time, over about 3 months, and we had to start bright and early to avoid the blistering summer heat. (Hipwaders are hot at the best of times.) But at least we had the mosquitos to keep us company! - Kerry
