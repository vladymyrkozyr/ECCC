Kathryn Bethune is a Professor of Geology at the University of Regina. She and her Ph.D. student, Dillon Johnstone, are investigating the regional setting and related structural controls of uranium deposits in the area. 
The primary aim is to create a fuller 2-D and 3-D picture of the major structural features and their relationship to the uranium deposits, as well as getting a fuller understanding of the sequence and timing of structures.
