Yesterday was the late Jack Minerâ€™s birthday! Jack Miner is a Canadian pioneering conservationist.

In 1904, he founded the Jack Miner Migratory Bird Sanctuary for the conservation of then endangered migrating Canada geese and wild ducks and was one of the first to track bird migration using leg bands. 
To commemorate his achievements and contributions to wildlife conservation, the National Wildlife Week Act was passed in 1947 to encourage Canadians to share information and take action for wildlife conservation just like Jack Miner did. Happy birthday Jack! .
