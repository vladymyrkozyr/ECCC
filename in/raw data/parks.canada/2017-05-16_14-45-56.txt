Cameron Falls is the ending point to one of Waterton National Park’s most popular trails – a 19 km one-way trek from Cameron Lake back to Waterton village. With views like this, it sure makes up for the effort!! When hiking in our parks, remember to leave natural objects such as plants, antlers, shells and driftwood undisturbed for others to discover and enjoy!
