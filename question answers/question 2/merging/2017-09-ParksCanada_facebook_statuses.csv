Kenow Fire Information Update ‚Äì Unified Command: September 11, 2017; 19:15 

FIRE MOVEMENT AND BEHAVIOUR 
‚Ä¢ Fire is now firmly established in the Cameron Valley along the Akamina Parkway. 
‚Ä¢ There is also fire in the Tamarack Basin which is expected to grow and move into the Blakiston Valley and towards the Red Rock Parkway. 
‚Ä¢ We continue to monitor the fire progress. 
‚Ä¢ Structural protection units will be activated if necessary. 
‚Ä¢ Extensive infrastructure and facility protection is installed within the townsite including high volume pump and sprinkler systems around the perimeter of town. 
‚Ä¢ Highways 5 and 6 are now closed at the boundaries of Waterton Lakes National Park. 
‚Ä¢ We are expecting similar weather and intense fire behaviour tomorrow. 

SMOKE 
‚Ä¢ Intense fire behaviour is generating significant smoke. Wind direction and temperature inversions may result in low-lying smoke in areas north of Waterton, especially at night. 
‚Ä¢ Exercise caution while driving in the area, especially at night. Check AB 511 for driving conditions. Speed limits or closures may be put in place. 
‚Ä¢ Wildfire smoke affects people differently. People with pre-existing health conditions or sensitivities to air pollution are at risk of worsened symptoms from smoke exposure. For smoke and air quality alerts visit: www.airhealth.ca
