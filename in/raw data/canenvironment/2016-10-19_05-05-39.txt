“Approaching Sand Heads, a weather station off Vancouver Island in the Georgia Strait. Sometimes, I go on familiarization trips as a meteorologist, for example, to replace and calibrate weather sensors. To do that, I hop into a hovercraft with the Canadian Coast Guard! You’re jealous, I know! In the background, one of our monitoring technicians and three coast guards unload our equipment onto the platform.” – Cindy YU, MSC Crew
