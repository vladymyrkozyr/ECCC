#COOLSCIENTISTALERT!
Hereâ€™s Lynne, a biologist with the Canadian Wildlife Service, admiring this Weidemeyerâ€™s while collecting genetic samples to help conserve the species.  The Weidemeyerâ€™s Admiral is a large butterfly that is only known in Canada from a small geographic area of southeastern Alberta. ðŸ˜¯ The species is listed as Special Concern under Canadaâ€™s Species at Risk Act, and little is known about the Canadian population. Cool fact:  males of the species are territorial â€“ they patrol and defend an area from all intruders.
