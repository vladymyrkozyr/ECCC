“It is good to have an end to journey toward; but it is the journey that matters, in the end.” – Ursula K. Le Guin

Dr. Fred Roots had quite the journey, and we owe him a lot. He lived a life full of exploration and discovery, and he played an influential role in the development of Environment Canada. From organizing the Polar Continental Shelf Program to chairing the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme, his accomplishments were many. Dr. Roots is also known for his contribution in writing the Antarctic Treaty—a treaty whose legacy lives on today. He will always be remembered.
