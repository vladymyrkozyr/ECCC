    "caption": "The Canadian Hurricane Centre is celebrating 30 years! In 1985 Hurricane Gloria was approaching the Maritime provinces but much of the info was focused on US impacts. The need for Canada-focused information eventually led to the creation of the CHC in 1987. The Centre now operates out of Dartmouth, NS and services all Canadian territory and waters that can be affected by tropical cyclones.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#Meteorology #Meteorologists #InstaWeather #InstaWeatherPro #EnvironmentCanada #Hurricane #WeatherForecast #CanadianHurricaneCentre",
