At the confluence of Tokumm Creek and the Vermilion River, Marble Canyon is one of the most colorful canyons in Kootenay National Park. The contrast between the green dwelling cliff plants, the grey limestone and the icy blue waters really does catch the eye! 
When hiking in our parks, remember that plants, antlers, shells and driftwood are not souvenirs! They are essential to the preservation of the ecosystem. ðŸŒ¿
