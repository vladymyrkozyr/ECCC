Do you remember me? Back in April, we held a contest to give me a name! I am a Common Loon and the mascot of the Canadian Wildlife Service here at Environment and Climate Change Canada. You suggested lots of great names. I chose “Kwimu,” which means “spirit bird” in many Indigenous languages. Since the name “Tuuli” was also very popular, I decided to give this name to the chick that I carry on my back. Tuuli means loon in Inuktitut. Thanks for participating! 🐤
