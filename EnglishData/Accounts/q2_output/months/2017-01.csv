Over the past decades the beautiful Petitcodiac River has been polluted by wastewater runoff and a weakened tidal bore. 

Infrastructure Canada is supporting New Brunswick's ongoing efforts to restore the river to its former glory by constructing a new bridge to realign the causeway, improving the direction and intensity of the water flow underneath. In the neighboring Riverview, Infrastructure Canada is funding upgrades to the TransAqua wastewater facility, adding a secondary level of treatment to ensure cleaner water flows into the Petitcodiac River.
