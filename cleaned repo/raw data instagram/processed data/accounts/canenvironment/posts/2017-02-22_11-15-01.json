Citizen scientists play an important role in many of our monitoring programs and provide biologists with invaluable information!\n\nWhile on a recent vacation to Cuba, nature photographer and citizen scientist, Alan Chaplin, did not know the Piping Plover he was snapping photos of was extraordinary. He reported the band only to discover that this bird had outlived its average lifespan by more than 4 times! The 17-year old plover was spotted near the same location our biologists banded it in 2000. It bred on Cavendish Beach in Prince Edward Island National Park in the early 2000s but had not been reported in over a decade. This resight is extremely useful for our scientists in understanding this at-risk species. Piping Plover continue to be marked in Canada, now with uniquely coded leg flags.\n\n#CitizenScientists #InstaScience #Biologists #BiologistsOfInstagram #PipingPlover #PloversOfInstagram #InstaPlovers #CanadianWildlifeService #SpeciesAtRisk #BirdBanding #BirdLovers #BirdsLover #CanEnvironment #EnvironmentCanada #MigratoryBirds",
