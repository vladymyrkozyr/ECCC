It breeds in a few dozen scattered locations off Alaska and Canada, but is more abundant in the northeast Atlantic. Once the bird was delivered to the Canadian Wildlife Service lab, Sabina and Regina examined it, determined that it wasn‚Äôt injured, and decided it was ready for release.

In 1908, the Board of Railway Commissioners assumed jurisdiction over Canada's early telephone and telegraph toll charges. 

And in 1910, the Board ruled that the CP, which was operating a telegraph news service, was using discriminatory pricing by charging a higher price for delivering messages that originated with other news services. In the telephone industry, a similar principle was used when Bell Telephone, which had a monopoly in a large part of Canada, was prohibited from providing content-based services. 

The Board's ruling established a basic principle of Canadian telecommunications - the separation of control of message content from control of transmission - an early expression of what is now called ""net neutrality"".

Kenow Fire Information Update ‚Äì Unified Command: September 11, 2017; 19:15 

FIRE MOVEMENT AND BEHAVIOUR 
‚Ä¢ Fire is now firmly established in the Cameron Valley along the Akamina Parkway. 
‚Ä¢ There is also fire in the Tamarack Basin which is expected to grow and move into the Blakiston Valley and towards the Red Rock Parkway. 
‚Ä¢ We continue to monitor the fire progress. 
‚Ä¢ Structural protection units will be activated if necessary. 
‚Ä¢ Extensive infrastructure and facility protection is installed within the townsite including high volume pump and sprinkler systems around the perimeter of town. 
‚Ä¢ Highways 5 and 6 are now closed at the boundaries of Waterton Lakes National Park. 
‚Ä¢ We are expecting similar weather and intense fire behaviour tomorrow. 

SMOKE 
‚Ä¢ Intense fire behaviour is generating significant smoke. Wind direction and temperature inversions may result in low-lying smoke in areas north of Waterton, especially at night. 
‚Ä¢ Exercise caution while driving in the area, especially at night. Check AB 511 for driving conditions. Speed limits or closures may be put in place. 
‚Ä¢ Wildfire smoke affects people differently. People with pre-existing health conditions or sensitivities to air pollution are at risk of worsened symptoms from smoke exposure. For smoke and air quality alerts visit: www.airhealth.ca
