Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS) biologist Steve Van Wilgenburg and Wildlife Tech Patrick Turgeon were working over the weekend, attaching automated recorders to trees in Greenwater Provincial Park (SK) to assist CWS monitor boreal forest bird populations. The acoustic recorders intermittently turn on and record the songs of species such as the Threatened Canada Warbler, which can then be identified by trained staff to allow biologists to determine species abundance and distribution. It also helps biologists determine which habitats are used by forest birds. CWS biologists use these recorders to go along with surveys normally conducted by trained staff primarily in the month of June.

In March, access to wet areas is easier on snowshoes, and allows biologists to capture data on resident species such as grouse, owls, chickadees and woodpeckers that breed earlier than migrants returning from the tropics.
