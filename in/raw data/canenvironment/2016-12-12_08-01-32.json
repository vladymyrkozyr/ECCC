    "caption": "\u201cHi there, we\u2019re two brand new sanderling #sandpipers checking in from the Great White North. We may only be a few hours old, but we are ready to go! Don\u2019t worry, mom and dad are close by as we get our vitals taken. But first, we\u2019ll get a few leg bands that will help track our progress as we migrate south for the #winter. Soon we\u2019ll be soaking up the sun \u2600\ufe0fon the Florida coast. You may have met our famous cousin, #PixarPiper? Her plumage is a little different from ours, but that\u2019s because we need to blend into the arctic tundra to keep predators at bay. We can\u2019t wait to grow into those beautiful silvery feathers, and to snack on some yummy clams on our own to a sunny beach.
