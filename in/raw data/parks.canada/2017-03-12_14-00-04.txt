This is the kind of scene you could be admiring in Riding Mountain National Park! Wildlife is more than abundant there, as black bear, elk, moose, lynx and many others call the park home. 
Although you might be smitten by the animals, remember to #KeepWildlifeWild and to stay at a safe distance from all these wild beauties!
