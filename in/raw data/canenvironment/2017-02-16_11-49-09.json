    "caption": "Sable Island is often referred to as the \u201cGraveyard of the Atlantic\u201d because of its many shipwrecks. A migratory bird \ud83d\udc26 sanctuary was established on the island in 1977, and covers the entire island, a crescent of sand extending along an east-west axis for approximately 32 km. And you can find wild horses \ud83d\udc34 here too!\n\n#Canada150  #ECcan150 #Canada #CanadianWildlife #Conservation #MigratoryBirds #SableIsland #Halifax #NS #NovaScotia #ExploreNS #AtlanticOcean #NoFilterNeeded #Habitat #HabitatConservation #CanEnvironment #EnvironmentCanada #BirdNerds #CanadianWildlifeService \ud83d\udcf8 Andrew Macfarlane",
