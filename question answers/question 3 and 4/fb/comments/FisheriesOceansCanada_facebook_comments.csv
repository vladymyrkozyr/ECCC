Whales have suffered West Nile virus and St. Louis encephalitis viruses and Zika shares this clade with over percent support. Source: N.A. right whales have been spotted as far south as the Bahamas and Mexico. They often have mouth abrasions. There are multiple ways Zika and/or Wolbachia could be infecting them. Mosquito bites are merely ONE way. Are we going to foolishly cling to Hertig's results on mice and chicken embryos? Or, are we going to acknowledge and devote resources to testing vertebrates (including humans) for the presence of Wolbachia? Because here are facts that are being willfully ignored: The direct effect of Wolbachia can either impede or promote the pathogen's replication and survival (Zug and Hammerstein, ). Examples of neutral or pro-pathogenic effect of Wolbachia include: Brugia pahangi (Dutton and Sinkins, ); Japanese encephalitis (JE) Virus (Tsai et al., ); Drosophila C Virus (Osborne et al., ); and Plasmodium gallinaceum (Baton et al., ).

This reproductive parasite (Wolbachia) and the Zika virus are in the eggs and larvae of mosquitoes which copepods and krill feed on. Some species only partially eat Aedes larvae causing their contents to spill out into sea water. Over ,000 cases of Zika were reported in Puerto Rico as of Oct. th, . The waters surrounding many islands in the Caribbean are obviously teeming with Zika-infected Aedes and Culex mosquitoes, eggs, and larvae. Testing for Zika should be a no-brainer to any seasoned pathologist. The ONLY conclusion that can solidly be drawn from this pathology report: TWO whales out of died from entanglement. The four or five attributed to blunt trauma based on ""severe internal bleeding"" could also be caused by infections or bleeding in transport or even foul play. When I asked Dr. Daoust about Zika, WNV, SLEV, and Wolbachia, he replied that these whales were in various states of decomposition, downplayed the likelihood of a mosquito biting them, and therefore these were not even considered or tested for. My own data (based on organic visits to a reference-based article I wrote about Zika in men) confirmed my worst fears: Overnight-active Culex spp. are probably responsible for the worst manifestations of the Zika. And Wolbachia is likely providing the mode of transportation to the gonads, heart, CNS, optic lobe, and retina. Zika (in men) has moved further north, into New York, the U.K. and Canada.

Technically salmon and rainbow and brown trout are all invasive in great lakes yet they spawned a multi billion dollar a year fishery and commercial fishery. Gobies which are invasive to great lakes used to be bad news...however eapecially in lake huron where we lost our alewives and consequncly % of our chinook salmon due to invasive musels filtering out the plankton and nutrients alewives needed to live...the gobies invaded...turns out the gobies find the mussels a delicasy!!! Inturn the lake trout and coho and browns and rainbow learned to adapt to gobies here and all species except the chinook (who r to picky and refuse to adapt to ensure there species) are thriving and then some on the gobies. So some invasives can actually benefit the existing ecosystem.... But snakeheads....ur right there so aggresive there like pike on steroids. U shud see there teeth! And there fast jaw clamp! If snakeheads got into great lakes all fish wud be in peril as theyd eat them!

I'm not about to argue Aboriginal Rights here, much has been written and said on that issue that not only the courts recognize as being valid but so does our government. The only rules that matter here are those that were created and self imposed on Aboriginal people by Aboriginal people, for millennia and those rules, we are now figuring out, worked better than the rules created by our fathers and forefathers imposed on Indigenous people when we came over and took over their land and resources with no consultation or compensation. Imagine an immigrant coming to your house and land and telling you that you have to move, that you will live under their law and that you will be limited on how you can support yourself and your family...... I don't believe you'd roll over and take this, nor do I think you wouldn't fight till your death to prevent this from happening to you and your community, yet that is exactly what Europeans did to the North American Indigenous people that occupied what we call ""America"" for thousands of years.

If you know anything about the economy of our province of NL we are told by some Ottawa personnel that we are on the verge of bankruptcy.

In 1949 when Newfoundland and Labrador became the 10th province of Canada, it brought with it a humungous load of wonderful natural resources, including a land mass 3 times the size of the other 3 Atlantic Provinces, hundreds of thousands of square kilometres of the Atlantic Ocean waters, the Air Space above, the Fish Resource, a large Hydroelectricity Resource, Minerals  of all types including Iron Ore, Nickel Ore, Gold, other ores, Oil and we have provided the rest of Canada with our Human Resource.  All of these resources brought Ottawa an enormous amount of revenue.

In 1949 when Canada succeeded in getting the province of NL as the 10th province after two referenda were held, Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent, in a speech to his Canadian subjects, said that getting the province of NL into the Canadian Federation was an 80 year dream of Canadians that began In 1867 when the Canadian Federation was formed.

Somebody in the Ottawa Federal Government needs to turn their eyes and ears and do a study to figure out how a province with so many great natural resources and such a wonderful natural location turned out to be destitute.  The attention needs be turned to what can be done to restore our province to the great economic position it should have been enjoying since 1949 given our great location and our great natural resource base.
