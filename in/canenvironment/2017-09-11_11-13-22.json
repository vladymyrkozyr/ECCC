This event had an amazing turnout, participants got to see presentations on the Monarch\u2019s biology, threats and declines, and the details of the Mission Monarch monitoring protocol. Participants had the opportunity to practice what they learned on the property, where they were thrilled to find several milkweed plants with Monarch caterpillars and eggs.\n.\n.\n.\n#CanadianWildlifeService #EnvironmentCanada #CitizenScience #MissionMonarque #MissionMonarch #Monarch #BigCreekNationalWildlifeArea #MontrealInsectarium #Caterpillars #Insects @espacepourlavie",
