We were lucky enough to see thick billed murres up close yesterday. Murres can dive over 200 meters deep in search of food and will fly 30 to 50 miles away from the island on their foraging flights. Have you ever seen one?\n.\n.\n.\n#CanadaC3 #ExploreCanada #ExploreNunavut #Seabirds #Arctic #Expedition #Birds \ud83d\udc27\ud83d\udc26\ud83d\udc24 \ud83d\udcf8Photo: @mikesudomaphoto",
