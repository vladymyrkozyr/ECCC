    "caption": "Tag a friend who can\u2019t compete with puffins! \nThe Tufted #Puffin spends most of its life at sea, coming\u00a0 to land only to breed during a few critical months. Puffins are powerful flyers, beating their wings 300-400 times a minute to achieve speeds up to 64 kph (40 mph). That would have just about any human puff-in through the day. \ud83d\udcf7: Catherine Jardine, Birds Studies Canada\n\n#Puffin\u00a0 #BC #ExploreBC #Wildlife #WildlifePhotography #PuffinOfInstagram #InstaBirds #Nature #NaturePhotography #ProtectedArea #ScottIslands #CanEnvironment #Breeding #BirdLovers #SeaAnimals #BirdWatching #EnvironmentCanada",
