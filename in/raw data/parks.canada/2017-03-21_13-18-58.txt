Happy #InternationalDayOfForests, probably one of our favourite days of the year!! 🌲 🌲 🌲 
Did you know one of our parks houses a rainforest? We're not kidding! In Pacific Rim National Park Reserve, you will find an open forest of trees so twisted and stunted they have taken a form of their own, and a mass of plants so thick it's impossible to see the soil beneath it. This luxurious abondance is due to rain, and lots of it, thanks to Pacific Ocean nearby. 🌧️ Picture by @taylormichaelburk
