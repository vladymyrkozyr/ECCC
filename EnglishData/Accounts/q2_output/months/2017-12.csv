Private James Peter Robertson was awarded posthumously the Victoria Cross for his extraordinary valour and devotion to duty while facing a hostile force in one of the most significant battles in World War I, at Passchendaele Belgium.

CP commissioned the plaque at the request of CP engineer Darrel Sundholm of Calgary Alberta. “After his family moved from Springhill Nova Scotia to Medicine Hat Alberta, James Peter Robertson joined the Canadian Pacific Railway, working his way up to locomotive engineer. He earned his nickname “Singing Pete” for his cheerful singing and whistling, whether in the cab or at the roundhouse,” said Sundholm. “The bravery that earned him the Victoria Cross made him a legend among locomotive engineers the world over.”

Steve Pauley, Commanding Officer of the Canadian Coast Guard ship named in Robertson's honour stated at the ceremony “In this, the 100th year anniversary of his death, it is our honour to share the story of Private Robertson’s service to our country and remember his ultimate sacrifice with dignity and respect.” Pauley added “This plaque will educate all who step aboard this ship for many years to come.”","The Canadian Coast Guard, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian Pacific Railway paid homage to a true Canadian hero with the unveiling of a commemorative plaque aboard the Canadian Coast Guard Ship Private Robertson V.C. in Burlington Ontario December .

The Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) ruled that revenues of the Canadian National Railway Company (CN) and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company (CP) have exceeded their Maximum grain revenue entitlements for crop year 2016-2017.

- CN’s grain revenue of $808,213,784 was $5,773,741 above its entitlement of $802,440,043.
- CP's grain revenue of $725,457,448 was $1,078, 947 above its entitlement of $724,378,501.

CN and CP now have 30 days to pay the amount by which they exceeded their 2016-2017 revenue entitlements, in addition to a five percent penalty of $288,687 for CN and $53,947 for CP. Regulations stipulate that such payments must be made to the Western Grains Research Foundation, a farmer-financed and directed organization set up to fund research that benefits Prairie farmers.
In the 2016-2017 crop year, 43,196,615 tonnes of Western grain were moved—6.9 percent more than the volume moved during the previous crop year. The average length of haul of 953 miles was two miles, or 0.2 percent, higher than the previous crop year.
