This month, we are celebrating the 70th anniversary of the Canadian Wildlife Service! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽˆ Our employees in the Canadian Wildlife Service have worked hard since 1947 to protect and manage migratory birds, species at risk, and their habitats. Did you know that they also manage 54 national wildlife areas and 92 Migratory Bird Sanctuaries?
