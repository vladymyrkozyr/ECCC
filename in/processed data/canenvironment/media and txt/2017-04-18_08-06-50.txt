Josh, Arvids, Andrew and Justin (University of Alberta & York University) arrived in Alert, Nunavut on Wednesday April 5 to take part in one of the largest Arctic expedition ever! They are scheduled to depart from Alert on 19 April. The campaign goal was to visit 15 sites along a few ESA (European Space Agency) CryoSat orbits between Alert and 88N,150W and perform a full suite of snow and ice measurements at each site. By doing all this, scientists can ensure that ice-thickness maps created from satellite data are correct. Cool right?  Photo 1: Large depth hoar crystals found within the snowpack on sea ice
