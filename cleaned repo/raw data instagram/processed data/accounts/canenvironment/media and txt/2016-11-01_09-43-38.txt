This winter, we are going to live vicariously through these whimbrels as they set their sights on warmer wintering grounds.

Working with partners, weâ€™ve equipped these migratory birds with transmitters to track their journey from Miscou Island in New Brunswick, Canada, to Brazil. Knowing where they are going and how fast they are travelling can give biologists a better idea of what sort of threats they might be facing during their travels. @mountallison @usfws
