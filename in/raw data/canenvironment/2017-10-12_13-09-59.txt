Brenda retired from the Canadian Wildlife Service in 2015, but she still returns each June to participate in the continent-wide North American Breeding Bird Survey. She has been surveying these routes in Southern Alberta and Saskatchewan since 1993 and has now completed 176 surveys! She is shown here surveying a route surrounded by native grasslands just outside of Drumheller in southeast Alberta.
