David Phillips, senior meteorologist at Environment and Climate Change Canada, calls 2017 “the year of too much” – the weather across the country was either too dry, too hot, or too wet. 
He’s compiled his annual list of the Top Ten Weather Stories in Canada during 2017. His list includes everything from catastrophic wildfires in British Columbia to severe winter storms in the Atlantic provinces. “The increased severity of our weather is certainly consistent with our expectations of rising global temperatures,” Phillips says. “This list demonstrates that our communities must become more resilient to the effects of climate change.”
