Dramatic skies overlook Gulf Islands National Park Reserve, which encompasses over 15 islands and numerous islets and reefs in the southern Strait of Georgia. Explore the secluded islands, but fear not, as you shall not be lonely! Sea lions, porpoises and killer whales will accompany you in your many adventures.
