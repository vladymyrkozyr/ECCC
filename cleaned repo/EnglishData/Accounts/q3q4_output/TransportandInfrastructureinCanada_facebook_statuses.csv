But what about the animals? The new Champlain Bridge is being built with all critters in mind. 

During construction, fish passages will allow finned friends to navigate the jetties in the water where work is taking place. Endangered brown snakes in the vicinity of the project will be relocated to safer homes and new habitat will be created nearby to ensure the snakes can repopulate the area after the work is completed. The new bridge will feature nesting boxes for Peregrine falcons in addition to other protective measures for migratory birds.

But what’s a pier cap? Well, it is the massive, W-shaped steel structure that the bridge’s three traffic corridors will rest on. 

As you can imagine, installation of this 261-ton giant is quite a feat. To lift each half-cap piece, two cranes are used to position it in the air vertically, and precisely set it onto the legs so that a second piece can be joined to it in exactly the same way.

The connection in the centre needs to be made with pinpoint accuracy to ensure the pier cap is solid and able to fully carry out its function.

Why? Because data and connected technology enable: 
• Openness
When communities make their data truly accessible, usable and barrier-free, their decision-making processes become transparent, empowering citizens and strengthening the relationship between residents and public organizations.
• Integration
Data and connected technology empower communities to break down silos that exist within local governments and public organizations. 
• Transferability
When tools and technological approaches are open-source, transparent and standardized, they can be used by communities across the country, no matter their size or capacity. 
• Collaboration
Connected technology enables communities to bring traditional and non-traditional partners together to collaborate.","A smart cities approach aims to achieve meaningful outcomes for residents through data and connected technology.
