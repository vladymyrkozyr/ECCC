Every winter, the historic Rideau Canal, a #UNESCO World Heritage Site, becomes the Rideau Canal Skateway, the worldâ€™s largest natural skating rink. 
Today at 1p.m., join Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, for a group skate on the Rideau Canal! The minister will be waiting for you at the Junction of the Rideau Canal National Historic Site and Dow's Lake (1000 Colonel By Drive). Expect marshmallows to roast, a genuine Parks Canada oTentik, and our one and only mascot, #Parka!
