Although bird feeders and baths make it easier for us to watch birds in their natural habitat, they can be harmful during an outbreak. You can help slow down the spread of Trichomonosis by removing bird feeders and baths and following  these simple steps: 

BIRD FEEDERS AND BATHS
1) Take down your bird feeders and bird baths. During the summer, there is enough natural food available, so there is no need to worry. 
2) Wash them thoroughly with a weak bleach solution (5% sodium hypochlorite).
3) Dispose of any wet or exposed feed left around your bird feeders and baths.
4) Refrain from putting them back in your yard until the cooler temperatures in the Fall.

Although the importance of wetlands is being recognized more and more; many of Canada’s wetlands in settled areas have been lost, and Canada continues to lose these important habitats – both naturally and because of human-related activities.

The National Wetland Conservation Fund (NWCF) supports organizations and communities across Canada to participate actively in the restoration and enhancement of degraded wetlands. For example, an NWCF project led by Ducks Unlimited Canada enhanced 140 hectares of wetland habitat throughout N.B., N.S. and P.E.I.
