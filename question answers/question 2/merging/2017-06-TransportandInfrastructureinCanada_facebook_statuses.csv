But what’s a pier cap? Well, it is the massive, W-shaped steel structure that the bridge’s three traffic corridors will rest on. 

As you can imagine, installation of this 261-ton giant is quite a feat. To lift each half-cap piece, two cranes are used to position it in the air vertically, and precisely set it onto the legs so that a second piece can be joined to it in exactly the same way.

The connection in the centre needs to be made with pinpoint accuracy to ensure the pier cap is solid and able to fully carry out its function.
