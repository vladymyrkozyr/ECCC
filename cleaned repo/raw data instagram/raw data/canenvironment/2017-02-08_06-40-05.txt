Believe it or not, this dreamy landscape is Canadian! This photo was taken at Gannet Islands Ecological Reserve, Newfoundland.

During July and August these islands are abuzz with activity!  It is quite an amazing sight to see thousands of seabirds!  Itâ€™s  definitely a privilege for some of our biologists to call this place their office during the field season.
