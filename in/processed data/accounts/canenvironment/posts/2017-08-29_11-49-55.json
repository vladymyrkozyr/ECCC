    "caption": "Today we\u2019re celebrating 100 years of bird conservation!  In 1916, the United States and Canada signed the Migratory Birds Convention- a pledge to protect Migratory Birds.  In 1917, the Migratory Birds Convention Act was hatched and it became law! Since then, nearly 400 birds have been protected and studied, to help sustain biodiversity, and to further understanding of the health of our environment.\n.\n.\n.\n#BirdNerds #BirdConservation #Fieldwork #BirdProtection #MigratoryBirds #FeatheredFriends #EnvironmentCanada #Wildlife #CanadianWildlife #BlackAndWhite #TBT #ThrowbackTuesday #InstaBird #VintageFashion",
