In these photos, Hannah and Paul, graduate students from Dr. Koper\u2019s lab at the University of Manitoba, are collaborating with Barry, an employee of the Canadian Wildlife Service to monitor Baird\u2019s Sparrow survival on breeding grounds outside of Brooks in southeastern Alberta. This project is part of a tri-national collaboration between Canada, the USA, and Mexico, with the goal of determining where and when the bird is most limited: on the breeding grounds in Canada and the USA, or the wintering grounds in Mexico. To monitor survival, we are deploying tiny Very High Frequency (VHF) transmitters in Alberta, while our partners at the Bird Conservancy of the Rockies deploy transmitters in Montana, North Dakota and Mexico. .\n.\n.\n#NativeGrasslands #GrasslandBirds #CanadianWildlifeService #Koperlab #BirdMonitoring #InstaBirds #Partnership #Biologists #Fieldwork #EnvironmentCanada #EnvironmentCan",
