    "caption": "We have a season-long program on Country Island, Nova Scotia to protect the Roseate Tern colony and assess their productivity. \nOne of the biggest jobs each season is to count the number of active Tern nests and in order to do that we usually bring a few extra people onto the island because of the number of nests and the fact that they\u2019re often in challenging vegetation and so hard to see!! This means, all hands on deck \u2026even directors and managers go on field trips! With views like these, who wouldn\u2019t like to get out in the field to work? Yes CWS, the social media team is extremely jealous.\n.\n.\n.\n#FieldTrip #FieldWork #TeamWork #BirdLover #CanadianWildlifeService #NovaScotia #BirdCount #HiddenGems #EnvironmentCanada #CanEnvironment #Flashback #Summer #WithNature #InstaBird #PhotoOfTheDay #WildlifePhoto #BirdNerd #BirdsOfInstagram \ud83d\udcf8: Garry Donaldson",
