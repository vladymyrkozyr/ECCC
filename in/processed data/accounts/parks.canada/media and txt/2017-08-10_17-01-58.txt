Qausuittuq National Park is officially open! Imagine a cluster of islands in a frozen sea, a home for the endangered Peary caribou, a traditional hunting and fishing area that has sustained Inuit of Resolute Bay since the time of their relocation in the 1950â€™s; #QausuittuqNP is all of that and more!
