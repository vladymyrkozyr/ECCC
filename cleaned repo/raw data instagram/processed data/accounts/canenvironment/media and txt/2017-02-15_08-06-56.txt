Queen Maud Gulf Migratory Bird Sanctuary might not be 150 yrs old but it is a #HiddenGem!

This beautiful region of the Canadian Arctic is an important nesting habitat for migratory birds like Ross' Goose. Covering over 62000 km2 of land and sea, this is Canadaâ€™s largest protected area! Whoa!

Learning more about these national treasures is a great start to conserving them and to celebrate #Canada150!
