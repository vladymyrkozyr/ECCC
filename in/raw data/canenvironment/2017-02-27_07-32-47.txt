Garry, Becky and Julie visited Cape Tormentine in search of wintering birds. They trekked through the snowy forest, and strolled the seaside finding a variety of forest birds, birds of prey and marine birds.  Notable among them, a wayward Eastern Meadowlark that should have been much farther south by then.
