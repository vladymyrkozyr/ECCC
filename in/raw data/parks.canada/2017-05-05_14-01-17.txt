The forested Gulf Islands are laced with lush trails leading to breathtaking views of the panoramic vistas of the Salish Sea! Take advantage of longer daylight hours by starting early. Consider an early morning start and you'll have the trail all to yourself! Always bring extra layers to stay warm and flashlights or headlamps to light the way as needed. And most importantly, enjoy the beautiful outdoors! ðŸ˜Š
