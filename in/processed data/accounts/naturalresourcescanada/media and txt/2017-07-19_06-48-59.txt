Today, we will be hiking through the bush to get some drill cores â€” samples of a natural material previously removed using a cylinder drill. 
While at the core storage area, we take samples and measurements from the drill core to get information about the subsurface. 
Sometimes the drill core is  only accessible by overgrown roads, so it can be quite the journey tracking it down!
