Here are 8 reasons why you should:
1) No or very little coordination is required. It’s simple to learn for all ages!
2) Little preparation time needed before leaving on a hike.
3) There’s low risk of injury and it’s easy on joints.
4) It’s a superior calorie-burner - about 500/hour.
5) It provides a great legs and buttocks workout - and arms too, if you add poles.
6) You can explore out-of-the-way places.
7) Snowshoeing is inexpensive - especially compared with other winter sports.
