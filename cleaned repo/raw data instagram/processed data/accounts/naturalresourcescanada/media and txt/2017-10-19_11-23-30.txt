#ICYMI â€“ Canadian #CleanTech innovation was showcased during the #GenEnergy forum. This battery-powered Eco-Marathon car was designed by @umecomotion, a group of engineering students at the University of Manitoba. The Eco-Marathon competition challenges students to design and build cars to see which vehicle can travel the farthest distance on a single litre of fuel. The car had to do 10 laps on a one-kilometre circuit and was judged on its kilometres per kilowatt hours. The team placed 14th out of 27 in the battery-electric prototype category in Detroit in April 2017.
