Today is all about connecting people to nature! Nature surrounds us and World Environment Day reminds us to take action to conserve and protect our natural environment. Breathe in the beauty and remember that by keeping our planet healthy, we keep ourselves healthy too.

Even as scientists discover new species (estimates suggest millions remain unknown), it is clear that our biodiversity is under threat – from competing land uses, pollution, population growth and human activities.

We’re working with partners to conserve our biodiversity.
