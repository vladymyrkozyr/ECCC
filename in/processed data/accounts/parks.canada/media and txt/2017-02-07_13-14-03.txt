Some call it the "world's longest museum‚Äù. The Chilkoot Trail was first crossed by Chilkoot Tlingit traders and later stormed by the Klondike Gold Rush stampeders. Let the spirit of people whose courage helped them survive the rugged northern wilderness inspire you. Hike the trail and share the challenge of those who reached the Klondike.
