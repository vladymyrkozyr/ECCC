The Canadian Wildlife Service\u2019s Arctic Shorebird Monitoring Program has been fortunate to have over 25 volunteers assist with our field program over the past 18 years! They put their lives on hold for 1-2 months to join us in the arctic in remote tent camps.\n\nWe are celebrating by highlighting the contribution citizen scientists make to our program by introducing a volunteer each day this week.\n\nToday, meet Fletcher Smith! Fletcher is a U.S. citizen who has volunteered over 6 months of his life coming to the tundra to help with our shorebird monitoring work. Fletcher is a special volunteer in that he also taught us how to fit Whimbrel (the bird Fletcher is holding in the photo) with tiny satellite backpacks that tell us where the birds are year round so we can have an understanding of where birds are when and what we can do to help conserve their populations.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#NationalVolunteerWeek2017 #NationalVolunteerWeek #Volunteering #SkilledVolunteers #CitizenScientists #ClosetBirdNerds #CenterForConservationBiology #ArcticShorebirdMonitoringProgram #CanadianWildlifeService #MigratoryBirds #InternationalVolunteers #MigratoryConnectivity #KendallIsland #FieldWork #InstaVolunteer #BeardsOfInstagram #BirdsOfInstagram #InstaBirds #Tundra",
