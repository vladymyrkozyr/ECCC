We love sharing videos and photos that highlight our staff's research and work that help to protect our amazing natural world. Now, here is your chance to show the rest of the world how special Canada is to YOU! ðŸ™ƒ
The Great Canadian Video Contest for World Environment Day is open to Canadians aged 18 to 25. Create a video showing how you are enjoying the mountains, beaches, forests or greenspaces around you, and why it is important to conserve and protect our natural heritage. Use #WEDCan to share your clip on Twitter and visit our web page to enter the contest.
