Welcome home, bison!
From Elk Island National Park to Banff National Park, the bison are now home again among the mountains. After being absent from the wild for over a century, their homecoming is a historic and cultural triumph.

For 16 months, the bison will remain in an enclosed pasture in the Panther Valley, closely monitored by Parks Canada. In approximately June 2018, the herd will be released to explore the full ~1200km2 reintroduction zone in the remote eastern slopes of Banff where they will interact with other native species, forage for food and fulfill their missing role in the ecosystem.
