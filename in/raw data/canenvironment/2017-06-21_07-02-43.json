    "caption": "These photos were taken during the Piping Plover census that takes place every five years throughout its breeding range which in Canada includes the prairies, Great Lakes, Quebec and Atlantic Canada.  In this set of pictures Andrew and Garry spent the day on Shediac Island which is off the coast of New Brunswick in the Northumberland Strait.  Even though they were in good habitat, they didn\u2019t find Piping Plovers but there were a few Least Sandpipers kicking around!! \ud83d\ude43\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#Sandpipers #InstaBirds #Shediac #ConservationWork #Conservation #BiologistOfInstagram #BiologistsOfInstagram #CanadianWildlife #CanadianWildlifeService #EnvironmentCanada #BirdCensus\n\ud83d\udcf8: Garry Donaldson",
