    "\n",
    "- Remove stopwords: English & French stopwords are loaded from two txt files into two sets. When a comment/post is detected as in French, detectable French stopwords will be removed. Otherwise, English stopwords will be removed accordingly. Note: the stopwords list needs to be updated to suit our purpose, for example, when we need to find out about the attitude/sentiment of comments, we should probably exclude words such as 'couldn't', 'cannot' or 'mustn't' from this list. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove non ascii characters: after this step, only digits, English & French characters are kept. Turn it off if it's unnecessary or removes too much implicit information such as emoji's.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tokenization: with MWETokenizer, multi-word tokens can be added based on our needs, for example, I've added 'climate change', 'canada150', 'justin trudeau' as customized tokens and counted their frequency in later step. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stemming: stem the tokens obtained from last step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Output tokens' & stemmers' frequency distribution: output csv files can be found in folder 'word_count', frequency of tokens and stemmers are listed in descending order. The freq_perc column is obtained by dividing the frequency of a word by the total number of comment/posts in each original csv file. Note: Note: there are duplicated tokens in each comment/post, we can choose to count the duplicate or not by commenting/uncommenting a line of code.\n"
