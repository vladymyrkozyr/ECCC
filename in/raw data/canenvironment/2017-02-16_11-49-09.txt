Sable Island is often referred to as the “Graveyard of the Atlantic” because of its many shipwrecks. A migratory bird 🐦 sanctuary was established on the island in 1977, and covers the entire island, a crescent of sand extending along an east-west axis for approximately 32 km. And you can find wild horses 🐴 here too!
