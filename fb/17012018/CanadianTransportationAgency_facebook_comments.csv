Concerned to see that the ONLY fines levied against the two major Canadian airlines (Air Canada & Westjet) in all of 2016 & 2017 YTD seem to be quite a contrast to what I regularly read in the media about airline behaviour.

AIR CANADA - a fine for $25,000 & another for $1,250 for pricing violations. Nothing for lost luggage, delayed or denied boarding, cancelled flights, passenger compensation issues.  NOTHING?

WESTJET - nothing in all of 2016 or 2017 YTD. NOTHING?

Is this accurate?  Am I missing some information for 2016 - 2017?

It is my opinion that a plane sitting on the tarmac even if it was due to weather should be liable to some extent for the delay. Given the media attention this had, the CTA should have went for the maximum of 900 which would have brought the fine closer to 540000! There is a huge lack of transparency in the CTA as to how the 295k was even reached, considering the airline already agreed to pay each passenger 500 so as to save face.

I'm reading and closely following the recent, high profile Air Transat incident in Ottawa (Case # 17-05835) where the CTA levied a fine of $295,000 due to be paid by Jan 3, 2018.  This appears to be a significant and appropriate penalty at first glance but becomes confusing, vague, and troubling when I read into the actual details on the CTA web page.

Can you please disclose the actual penalty Air Transat will be paying given that I am reading that the CTA has ""discretion"" on the actual collection of said fine?  This is confusing and very important to fully understand.

Thanks for your question.

The Agency does not have jurisdiction on travel insurance so we can't really answer that portion of your question.

Flight cancellations are covered by the airline's tariff and do fall within the Agency mandate. Complaints are addressed on a case by case basis and without all the details we can't really comment on what kind of compensation, if any, would be owed to the couple in question.

If someone is dealing with lost or delayed baggage, they should make a claim with their air carrier as soon as possible. An air carrier establishes the time limits under which these claims must be submitted.  Internationally, those time limits are governed by the Montreal Convention. 

All air carriers must respect its tariff (these are the terms and conditions for a person's flight). The air carriers tariff  also establishes the extent to which an air carrier is liable for lost, delayed or damaged baggage.  

If a person is not able to resolve their baggage claim with the airline, they can file a complaint with us and we can examine the matter in further detail.

If you believe there is an issue with the clarity of information communicated by the air carrier based on the decision you reference, you can file a complaint about this as well and we will look into this further.",2017-10-11 13:20:32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In these types of situations, the CTA has the authority to ensure that air carriers facing financial challenges do not leave passengers stranded and uncertain about their options. In 2015,  when it became concerned that SkyGreece was failing to meet its legal obligations to passengers, the CTA issued, on its own motion, a “show cause” order to SkyGreece indicating that unless the airline could offer some counter-argument, it would be ordered within 24 hours to inform all passengers of their options (including getting a refund or transporting them using another airline), implement the option chosen by the passengers, establish a help line and update its website to fully explain the measures in place to address the situation. When SkyGreece declared bankruptcy, the CTA immediately began to help affected SkyGreece ticket holders by providing timely advice about their options, rights and recourse. Also, in 2005, when Jetsgo ceased its operations, the CTA issued charter permits on a priority basis to allow alternative airlines to transport stranded passengers.",2017-10-11 08:46:38,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Here in Canada, there is a division of responsibilities for consumer protection between the federal and provincial Governments. Travel Agents and tour operators are under provincial jurisdiction and are not licenced or regulated by the CTA. As a result, there is no single national programme for the collection of fees and maintenance of a fund to be used to return passengers stranded as a result of airline failure.  

You should also know that the Transportation Modernization Act (Bill C-49) that is currently being debated in Parliament aims to address some air passenger issues by mandating the CTA to make new regulations defining airlines' minimum obligations when flights are delayed or cancelled, passengers are denied boarding (bumped), baggage is lost or damaged, tarmac delays over three hours occur, children under the age of 14 are travelling with a parent or guardian, or passengers are transporting musical instruments. The Air Passenger Protection Regulations we will make, if and when Bill C-49 is passed, will take us beyond a model based solely on individual airline tariffs.

Thanks for bringing this to our attention. This situation wasn't the result of any intentional block but an overly aggressive default configuration on a new email component.

On Friday, August 11th around 11h00 we updated our email system. The default configurations for the new version are more strict than the older versions.

Amendment 17:
The Act is amended by adding the following after section 67.‍2:
Person affected
67.‍3 Despite sections 67.‍1 and 67.‍2, a complaint against the holder of a domestic license related to any term or condition of carriage concerning any obligation prescribed by regulations made under subsection 86.‍11(1) may only be filed by a person adversely affected.

Amendment 18:
Subparagraph 86(1)‍(h)‍(iii) of the Act is replaced by the following:
(iii) authorizing the Agency to direct a licensee or carrier to take the corrective measures that the Agency considers appropriate and to pay compensation for any expense incurred by a person adversely affected by the licensee’s or carrier’s failure to apply the fares, rates, charges or terms or conditions of carriage that are applicable to the service it offers and that were set out in its tariffs, if the Agency receives a written complaint and, if the complaint is related to any term or condition of carriage concerning any obligation prescribed by regulations made under subsection 86.‍11(1), it is filed by the person adversely affected,

That's right. You are proposing to effectively eliminate any consumer advocacy groups or persons from the traveling public's side of the complaint process and leaving individual ""persons adversely affected"" to fend off airline lawyers, experts, advocates, etc.  THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS & UNACCEPTABLE !!!

Perhaps a more equitable balance would be to then have airlines ONLY able to counter complaints via the unassisted response ONLY from the front line employee who was most directly involved in ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE CUSTOMER to borrow your terminology.

Sounds pretty ridiculous when put in that light, doesn't it?

These amendments should be abandoned and replaced with amendments that support consumer advocacy and a level playing field....not to mention free speech and uncensored dialogue.",2017-07-28 18:45:43,4,2,1,1,0,0,0,0
