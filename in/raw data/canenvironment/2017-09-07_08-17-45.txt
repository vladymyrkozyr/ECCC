Yesterday was World Shorebird Day! Itâ€™s all about raising awareness of shorebirds! In our half of the world these long-distance migrants breed in the Arctic in May-August and winter in South America. They face numerous challenges on their journey so protecting the habitats they need to complete their annual cycle is a cooperation of governments, industries, scientists, volunteers and citizens throughout the western hemisphere (and the world!).
