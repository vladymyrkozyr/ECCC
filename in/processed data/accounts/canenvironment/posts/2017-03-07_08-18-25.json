    "caption": "Our biologists spotted 15 species of birds while on a quick stroll into the frozen wetlands of John Lusby Marsh National Wildlife Area for the Amherst, Nova Scotia Christmas Bird Count. Nearly half of them were Arctic breeding migratory birds that reach the Atlantic Provinces in winter, such as the Snow Bunting (aka  the \u201csnowflake\u201d), Lapland Longspur, Rough-legged Hawk, as well as Glaucous and Iceland Gulls. During their short visit, the team was especially surprised to find three Short-eared Owls flying together as a group, a rare delight!\n.\n.\n.\n\n#ChristmasBirdCount #NovaScotia #BiologistsOfInstagram #InstaScience #BirdCount #NatureLovers #Wetlands #NationalWildlifeArea #CanadianWildlifeService #CanEnvironment #HiddenGem #PerksOfFieldwork #EnvironmentCanada #Adventures #Fieldwork #Canada #AtlanticCanada",
