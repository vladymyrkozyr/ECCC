    "caption": "Do you remember me? Back in April, we held a contest to give me a name! I am a Common Loon and the mascot of the Canadian Wildlife Service here at Environment and Climate Change Canada. You suggested lots of great names. I chose \u201cKwimu,\u201d which means \u201cspirit bird\u201d in many Indigenous languages. Since the name \u201cTuuli\u201d was also very popular, I decided to give this name to the chick that I carry on my back. Tuuli means loon in Inuktitut. Thanks for participating! \ud83d\udc24\n.\n.\n.\n#CommonLoon #Bird #InstaBird #Wildlife #CanadianWildlifeService #EnvironmentCanada #EnvironmentCan",
