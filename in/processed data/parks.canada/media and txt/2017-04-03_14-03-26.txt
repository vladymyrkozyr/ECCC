Happy #FindARainbowDay! 
Follow the rainbow and you might find yourself in Vuntut National Park, a truly magical park in northern #Yukon. It is the setting for one of the planetâ€™s great animal migrations, as the porcupine caribou herd treks through Vuntut National Park and into Ivvavik National Park, all the way to Alaska. At this time of the year, they're just about to start their journey!
