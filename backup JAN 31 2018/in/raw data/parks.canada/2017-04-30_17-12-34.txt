Drumrolls please! Come on, you can do better! *louder drumrolls* 
This our 150th post!!!!!!! Very fitting since we're also celebrating #Canada150 this year ðŸ˜‰ 
It will be a busy year for us, so make sure to plan your vacations with us ahead of time or, even better, visit us during the shoulder seasons!
