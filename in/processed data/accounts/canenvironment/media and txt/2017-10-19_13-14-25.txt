People have been part of our conservation work for a long time - this photo was taken at Vaseux Lake in 1909 and is now a National Wildlife Area. We are updating the list of allowable activities found in the Wildlife Area Regulations. A consultation is underway until October 25th and we want to hear from you. TAP the link in our bio for more info!
