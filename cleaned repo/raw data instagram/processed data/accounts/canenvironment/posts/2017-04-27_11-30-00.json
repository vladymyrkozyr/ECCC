    "caption": "National Volunteer Week is a special time to recognize all the people who donate their time to make our work possible. In today\u2019s volunteer spotlight, meet Adam Fritz! Adam has volunteered two summers for the Canadian Wildlife Service\u2019s Arctic Shorebird Monitoring Program. His background in policy is about as far as you can get from birds \u2013 until you consider that conservation takes policy work to make it happen. Adam took vacation from his federal government job to assist with monitoring birds on the tundra. That\u2019s 7 weeks he could have been vacationing with his family in a warm and sunny location! Not all arctic fieldwork is glamourous, in this pic we are playing cards to pass the time waiting for the fog to clear so we can get out and do our work.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#NationalVolunteerWeek2017 #NationalVolunteerWeek  #FieldWork #Volunteering #Shorebirds #WildlifeMonitoring #CanadianWildlifeService #ArcticScience",
