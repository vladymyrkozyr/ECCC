Wildlife is more than abundant there, as black bear, elk, moose, lynx and many others call the park home. \nAlthough you might be smitten by the animals, remember to #KeepWildlifeWild and to stay at a safe distance from all these wild beauties! \nBeautiful picture by @prairiefoto \n#fox #manitoba #exploremb #ridingmountainnp #ridingmountain #ridingmountainnationalpark #wildlifephotography #wildlife #explorecanada #canada #canada150 #parkscanada"
