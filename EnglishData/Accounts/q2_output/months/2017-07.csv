It is a bird parasite that affects the upper digestive tract of birds, limiting their ability to swallow and keep their food down. 

Although bird feeders and baths make it easier for us to watch birds in their natural habitat, they can be harmful during an outbreak. You can help slow down the spread of Trichomonosis by removing bird feeders and baths and following  these simple steps: 

BIRD FEEDERS AND BATHS
1) Take down your bird feeders and bird baths. During the summer, there is enough natural food available, so there is no need to worry. 
2) Wash them thoroughly with a weak bleach solution (5% sodium hypochlorite).
3) Dispose of any wet or exposed feed left around your bird feeders and baths.
4) Refrain from putting them back in your yard until the cooler temperatures in the Fall.

Their work focuses on conserving and protecting seabirds, some of which are at-risk. Recently an apparently injured Northern Fulmar seabird was found on an offshore support vessel near Newfoundland and Labrador. The fulmar features large black eyes and a striking short, tube-like beak and resembles a gull; however it is actually related to the albatross and shearwater. It breeds in a few dozen scattered locations off Alaska and Canada, but is more abundant in the northeast Atlantic. Once the bird was delivered to the Canadian Wildlife Service lab, Sabina and Regina examined it, determined that it wasn’t injured, and decided it was ready for release. They took it to Witless Bay where a small colony of other fulmars breeds on three islands in the area. They watched the bird drink and vigorously bathe until it swam out of range toward the mouth of the bay.

In 1908, the Board of Railway Commissioners assumed jurisdiction over Canada's early telephone and telegraph toll charges. 

And in 1910, the Board ruled that the CP, which was operating a telegraph news service, was using discriminatory pricing by charging a higher price for delivering messages that originated with other news services. In the telephone industry, a similar principle was used when Bell Telephone, which had a monopoly in a large part of Canada, was prohibited from providing content-based services. 

The Board's ruling established a basic principle of Canadian telecommunications - the separation of control of message content from control of transmission - an early expression of what is now called ""net neutrality"".
