In 1908, the Board of Railway Commissioners assumed jurisdiction over Canada's early telephone and telegraph toll charges. 

And in 1910, the Board ruled that the CP, which was operating a telegraph news service, was using discriminatory pricing by charging a higher price for delivering messages that originated with other news services. In the telephone industry, a similar principle was used when Bell Telephone, which had a monopoly in a large part of Canada, was prohibited from providing content-based services. 

The Board's ruling established a basic principle of Canadian telecommunications - the separation of control of message content from control of transmission - an early expression of what is now called ""net neutrality"".

The Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) ruled that revenues of the Canadian National Railway Company (CN) and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company (CP) have exceeded their Maximum grain revenue entitlements for crop year 2016-2017.

- CN’s grain revenue of $808,213,784 was $5,773,741 above its entitlement of $802,440,043.
- CP's grain revenue of $725,457,448 was $1,078, 947 above its entitlement of $724,378,501.

CN and CP now have 30 days to pay the amount by which they exceeded their 2016-2017 revenue entitlements, in addition to a five percent penalty of $288,687 for CN and $53,947 for CP. Regulations stipulate that such payments must be made to the Western Grains Research Foundation, a farmer-financed and directed organization set up to fund research that benefits Prairie farmers.
In the 2016-2017 crop year, 43,196,615 tonnes of Western grain were moved—6.9 percent more than the volume moved during the previous crop year. The average length of haul of 953 miles was two miles, or 0.2 percent, higher than the previous crop year.
