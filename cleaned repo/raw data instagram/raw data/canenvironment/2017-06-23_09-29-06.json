    "caption": "Did you know that endangered species conservation is sometimes complex and multi-national? This endangered burrowing owl was fitted with a satellite transmitter near her nest in Alberta in 2015.  The solar-powered transmitter allows scientists with the Canadian Wildlife Service and project collaborators to track her movements wherever she goes.  After leaving her burrow in Alberta this bird flew over 3,500km to winter in Central Mexico. \ud83d\ude32\n\nIn spring 2016 she returned to Alberta and nested less than 3km from where she was first captured.  She was recently sighted by biologists in Mexico in the same wintering site as the year before, and we are hoping she makes a safe and successful return to Canada to raise the next generation of owls. \ud83e\udd89\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#DYK #FunFacts #MigratoryBirds #BirdYear #BiologistsOfInstagram #InstaScience #Science #WildlifeLovers #CanadianWildifeService #WildlifeConservation #CanadianWildlife #OwlsLover #CuteOwls #OwlsPic #InstaOwls #EnvironmentCanada #CanEnvironment",
