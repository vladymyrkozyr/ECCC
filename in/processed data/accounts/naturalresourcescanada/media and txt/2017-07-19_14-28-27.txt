Welcome to “Come dine with me Athabasca,” where Canada’s best and brightest government scientists battle it out to become ultimate camp chef! 
Because we are in a smaller camp, we cook our own food and each member is responsible for at least one communal dinner. This can often lead to some friendly competition as to who’s the best cook.
