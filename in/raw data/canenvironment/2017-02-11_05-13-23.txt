Today is the International Day of Women and Girls in Science! We have the honor to work with many female scientists, including these 3! Jesse, Marianna and Sara are meteorologists working at the Prairie and Arctic Storm Prediction Centre. They graduated from the Atmospheric Science Program at the University of Alberta. Impressive right? ðŸ¤—
