Quttinirpaaq is an Inuktitut word meaning “top of the world”. The name was well chosen, as Quttinirpaaq National Park contains the highest Canadian peak east of the Rockies, Barbeau Peak, soaring at 2,616 metres above sea level. In this picture, you can admire the Tanquary Fjord, with Rollrock Valley in distance.
