Here’s biologist Kerry, reporting from the field at Last Mountain Lake NWA. While the wildflowers were thriving, this 4-year-old restoration site needed, and still needs a helping hand. Her plan was to *inter-seed native prairie grasses, and here she was deciding which species and in what amounts. Her team sowed and mowed over the course of the season, and soon there will be a sea of grasses for the birds and wildlife to live in! *Inter- seeding yields a mixture of grasses and legumes/forbs that gives the fullest benefit for wildlife or forage for livestock. It’s a good way to improve existing stands of single species grasses on fields utilized for pasture, wildlife, or idle land.
