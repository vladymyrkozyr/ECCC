In honour of Women’s History Month, we are paying homage to Esther Marjorie Hill– Canada’s first female architect.

Esther graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in architecture in 1920, becoming the first woman to do so anywhere in Canada. Her passion for design inspired a legacy of projects across the country. 

From the interior design of the former Eaton’s department store in Toronto, to the conception of the Edmonton public library, to the design of various residential buildings in Victoria, B.C., her extensive resume has diversified Canadian architectural design and paved the way for other women to do the same.","Throwback Thursday!
