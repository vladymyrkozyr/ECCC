It’s spring time under the stars and we’re calling all Star Wars fans, stargazers and amateur astronomers! This week, snap a picture while out observing the night sky and share it with us by using #ParksChallenge. Want to complete the challenge but don’t know where to go stargazing? The #RoyalAstronomicalSociety of Canada has designated nine of our sites as #DarkSkyPreserves! 
Beautiful picture taken in Grasslands National Park by @daleboan
