A supersite has a variety of weather instruments that allow scientists to measure atmospheric conditions in detail. \nFor people living in the North, information like the temperature and humidity isn\u2019t as important as they are in the South. Knowing about blowing snow and ice-fog (a fog made up of small ice crystals suspended in the air!) are much more relevant! \nThe new sites will help us understand what weather instruments will work best, so that we can improve weather forecasts in the North.\n.\n.\n.\n#Iqaluit #Nunavut #Whitehorse #Yukon #WeatherWednesday #EnvironmentCanada #EnvironmentCan #Arctic #ArcticScience #WeatherScience #Weather",
