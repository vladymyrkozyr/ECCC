We take that role very seriously. Here in Canada, there is a division of responsibilities for consumer protection between the federal and provincial Governments. Travel Agents and tour operators are under provincial jurisdiction and are not licenced or regulated by the CTA. As a result, there is no single national programme for the collection of fees and maintenance of a fund to be used to return passengers stranded as a result of airline failure. You should also know that the Transportation Modernization Act (Bill C-49) that is currently being debated in Parliament aims to address some air passenger issues by mandating the CTA to make new regulations defining airlines' minimum obligations when flights are delayed or cancelled, passengers are denied boarding (bumped), baggage is lost or damaged, tarmac delays over three hours occur, children under the age of are travelling with a parent or guardian, or passengers are transporting musical instruments. The Air Passenger Protection Regulations we will make, if and when Bill C-49 is passed, will take us beyond a model based solely on individual airline tariffs. I encourage you to participate in the upcoming consultations. Information on them can be found on our website: .

We take that role very seriously.

Here in Canada, there is a division of responsibilities for consumer protection between the federal and provincial Governments. Travel Agents and tour operators are under provincial jurisdiction and are not licenced or regulated by the CTA. As a result, there is no single national programme for the collection of fees and maintenance of a fund to be used to return passengers stranded as a result of airline failure.  

You should also know that the Transportation Modernization Act (Bill C-49) that is currently being debated in Parliament aims to address some air passenger issues by mandating the CTA to make new regulations defining airlines' minimum obligations when flights are delayed or cancelled, passengers are denied boarding (bumped), baggage is lost or damaged, tarmac delays over three hours occur, children under the age of 14 are travelling with a parent or guardian, or passengers are transporting musical instruments. The Air Passenger Protection Regulations we will make, if and when Bill C-49 is passed, will take us beyond a model based solely on individual airline tariffs.

Thanks for bringing this to our attention. This situation wasn't the result of any intentional block but an overly aggressive default configuration on a new email component.

On Friday, August 11th around 11h00 we updated our email system. The default configurations for the new version are more strict than the older versions. So emails were getting bounced at 10h58 according to our logs. We have reconfigured the new components and messages should now be getting through to us.

The details, context and evidence in any particular case largely determine its outcome. In a dispute between air travelers and airlines, we will look at all the evidence provided to us to determine if an airline has applied its tariff properly and if the tariff is appropriate. Each situation is different and each case needs to be decided based on the evidence provided by all the parties. Where an enforcement officer has determined a violation has occurred, they may — where it considers it appropriate—issue warnings or fines. In cases before the Agency, the panel can order an airline to take corrective measures, impose monetary penalties, or compensate passengers.

1. Institutional Bias
The Agency has stated to the press that:

3. Vice-Chair: Former Airline Lobbyist
Mr. Sam Barone, the Vice-Chair, was a lobbyist for airlines until his appointment to the Agency. Mr. Barone’s:

Act via Bill C-49 as follows:

Amendment 17:
The Act is amended by adding the following after section 67.‍2:
Person affected
67.‍3 Despite sections 67.‍1 and 67.‍2, a complaint against the holder of a domestic license related to any term or condition of carriage concerning any obligation prescribed by regulations made under subsection 86.‍11(1) may only be filed by a person adversely affected.

Amendment 18:
Subparagraph 86(1)‍(h)‍(iii) of the Act is replaced by the following:
(iii) authorizing the Agency to direct a licensee or carrier to take the corrective measures that the Agency considers appropriate and to pay compensation for any expense incurred by a person adversely affected by the licensee’s or carrier’s failure to apply the fares, rates, charges or terms or conditions of carriage that are applicable to the service it offers and that were set out in its tariffs, if the Agency receives a written complaint and, if the complaint is related to any term or condition of carriage concerning any obligation prescribed by regulations made under subsection 86.‍11(1), it is filed by the person adversely affected,

That's right. You are proposing to effectively eliminate any consumer advocacy groups or persons from the traveling public's side of the complaint process and leaving individual ""persons adversely affected"" to fend off airline lawyers, experts, advocates, etc.  THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS & UNACCEPTABLE !!!

Perhaps a more equitable balance would be to then have airlines ONLY able to counter complaints via the unassisted response ONLY from the front line employee who was most directly involved in ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE CUSTOMER to borrow your terminology.

Sounds pretty ridiculous when put in that light, doesn't it?
