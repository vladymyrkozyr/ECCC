Meet the Clark’s nutcracker, found in seven national parks, including #JasperNP. These guys hide whitebark pine seeds under their tongues and cache them under a shallow layer of soil for winter. Since the pine cones don’t open on their own, the Clark’s nutcracker’s work plays an essential role in seeding whitebark pine, which is declining throughout its range. 📍: Jasper National Park 📷: @skycladtrvlr
