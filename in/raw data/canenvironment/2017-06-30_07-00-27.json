    "caption": "On this photo, Josh is dusting it up at Last Mountain Lake National Wildlife Area (NWA) in Saskatchewan. This biologist is helping to restore migratory bird and wildlife habitat by seeding native prairie grasses and wildflowers. Not far down the road is biologist Denise, checking her progress as she tends to a young restoration area. Mowing reduces weeds and help new grassland plants to thrive! Soon enough these areas will be teeming with Savannah Sparrows, Deer Mice, Red-Backed Voles, Swainson\u2019s and Red-Tailed Hawks.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#Flashback #LastSummer #SummerDays #HabitatRestoration #ForTheBirds #NationalWildlifeArea #LastMountainLake #Saskatchewan #BiologistLife  #WhatAView #Prairies #PrairieSkies #FieldWork #WildlifeResearch #InstaScience #Biologists #EnvironmentCan #EnvironmentCanada #Mowing #BiologistsofInstagram #Conservation",
