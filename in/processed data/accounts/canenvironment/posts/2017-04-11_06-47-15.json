    "caption": "Yesterday was the late Jack Miner\u2019s birthday! Jack Miner is a Canadian pioneering conservationist.\n\nIn 1904, he founded the Jack Miner Migratory Bird Sanctuary for the conservation of then endangered migrating Canada geese and wild ducks and was one of the first to track bird migration using leg bands. \nTo commemorate his achievements and contributions to wildlife conservation, the National Wildlife Week Act was passed in 1947 to encourage Canadians to share information and take action for wildlife conservation just like Jack Miner did. Happy birthday Jack! .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#NationalWildlifeWeek #CanadianWildlifeService #CanadianWildlifeWeek #CanadianWildlife #WildlifeConservation #MigratoryBirds #MigratoryBird #BirdSanctuary #Canada #JackMiner #Canada150 #WithNature \ud83d\udcf8: Library and Archives Canada / Ronny Jaques",
