Morning Sunrise on the ice 😍 “It was a beautiful -40 degree morning in Makkovik that day...😰 During the winter months communities on the north coast of Labrador transition to #snowmobiles for transportation within their communities.  The sea ice also becomes another type of roadway linking residents with their cabins and other communities in the winter months.  #Skidoo travel continues until the sea ice breaks up in the spring.

One of the best parts of our jobs is the chance to visit the beautiful throughout Labrador! “ – Regina, CWS Crew
