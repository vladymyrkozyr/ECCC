Kenow Fire Information Update – Unified Command: September 11, 2017; 19:15 

FIRE MOVEMENT AND BEHAVIOUR 
• Fire is now firmly established in the Cameron Valley along the Akamina Parkway. 
• There is also fire in the Tamarack Basin which is expected to grow and move into the Blakiston Valley and towards the Red Rock Parkway. 
• We continue to monitor the fire progress. 
• Structural protection units will be activated if necessary. 
• Extensive infrastructure and facility protection is installed within the townsite including high volume pump and sprinkler systems around the perimeter of town. 
• Highways 5 and 6 are now closed at the boundaries of Waterton Lakes National Park. 
• We are expecting similar weather and intense fire behaviour tomorrow. 

SMOKE 
• Intense fire behaviour is generating significant smoke. Wind direction and temperature inversions may result in low-lying smoke in areas north of Waterton, especially at night. 
• Exercise caution while driving in the area, especially at night. Check AB 511 for driving conditions. Speed limits or closures may be put in place. 
• Wildfire smoke affects people differently. People with pre-existing health conditions or sensitivities to air pollution are at risk of worsened symptoms from smoke exposure. For smoke and air quality alerts visit: www.airhealth.ca 

WHAT’S OPEN AND CLOSED… 
• Waterton Lakes National Park is Closed: www.parkscanada.ca/waterton-kenow-fire 
• Calgary Forest Protection Area south of Highway 532 is Closed: http://srd.web.alberta.ca/calgary-area-update

137563459593611_1867011269982146,"Kenow Fire - Waterton Lakes National Park: September 8, 2017; 19:15hr
Parks Canada and RCMP have safely evacuated all residents and non-essential personnel from the park. The Waterton townsite is secured. Admittance at the gate is limited to essential personnel. Intense fire behavior and low visibility caused a risk to safety. To ensure safety, Parks Canada evacuated Waterton.  We understand this is a stressful situation and thank everyone for their cooperation, making this a safe and efficient evacuation process.
The fire did not cross Sage Pass or South Kootenay Pass into the park and helicopters were able to bucket water later in the afternoon. Fire crews enhanced Waterton’s infrastructure and facility protection. Yesterday afternoon we successfully burned out approximately 30 hectares of vegetation near South Kootenay Pass, removing this fuel in anticipation of increasing wind and fire behaviour today. Burning these fuels under calmer conditions increased our chances of holding the fire at this location. Weather conditions are expected to increase fire behaviour for the next two days:

Why? To identify feeding grounds.

1) No or very little coordination is required. It’s simple to learn for all ages!
2) Little preparation time needed before leaving on a hike.
3) There’s low risk of injury and it’s easy on joints.
4) It’s a superior calorie-burner - about 500/hour.
5) It provides a great legs and buttocks workout - and arms too, if you add poles.
6) You can explore out-of-the-way places.
