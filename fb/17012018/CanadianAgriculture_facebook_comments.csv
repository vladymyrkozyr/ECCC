""When we consider that a form of GMO corn that was banned from the US market over a decade ago is now resurfacing in edible products in a distinct country like Saudi Arabia, whose GM import and labeling laws are much more stringent than our own, we can only wonder how prevalent StarLink™ corn contamination still is in the US. If anything, this underscores how dangerous GM agriculture is in producing a type of bio-pollution whose contamination of the biosphere is uncontrollable and irrevocable. Given these latest findings, we believe it is advisable to push for renewed testing of StarLink™ maize in US corn-containing products, and further the cause for mandatory labeling of GM-containing products and/or a total boycott of any and all manufacturers who are not already complying with this objective, or do not already have plans to do so in the immediate future.""

The soil, as whole, (which would include both the clay particles in the soil and the minerals bound by the clay) actually has no electric charge. The negative charge of the clay particles is offset by the positive charge of the minerals.

No. 
Considering that we need to continue trying to feed a rapidly growing human population, while at the same time reducing agriculture's impact on the environment, I am not a fan of inefficient agricultural methods that require more land to produce less food.  

»""so many people like me that don't want chemicals on their food""«
Apparently you don't even know what the word ""chemical"" even means.  
It might surprise you to open up a child's science textbook and learn that EVERYTHING is a chemical. 

»""The well water is not safe to drink”«
Do you have test results from an accredited laboratory confirming that it is not safe, and explaining the reasons why? 

»""the air and the soil is poisoned""«
Yet, you're breathing the air and you're still alive and well, and vegetation is still growing in that soil. 

»”They don't even grow food for their own family anymore, they go and buy everything from IGA, but they call themself farmers""«
It appears that you are completely confused about who is a farmer and who is a gardener. 

I'm certainly not a large farmer, considering the average size of a prairie grain farm, I would be considered a small farmer in my area. 
But I do earn my livelihood from growing crops that are used for food. So, according to the simplest definition of a ""farmer"" I guess I am one. 
Whether I choose to have my own vegetable garden, some chickens and a milk cow to feed myself, or simply buy my food at a store is irrelevant to the fact that I am a farmer who makes my living growing crops.",2017-08-24 20:34:04,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

First, organic crops have way less disease and insect problems and in some cases, less weed preasure.. Second, in general, organic wheat has higher protein. farmers I have talked to tell me that before the converted to organic they struggled to get 13%. Third, some organic farmers are getting better than average yields, and trying to compare organic to conventional is like comparing conventional to conventional. A good canola yield in my area is considered a failure just 20 miles north. Depending on the land, smaller farmers get more bushels per field than larger ones. Why is it that all farmers talk about is how expensive it is to grow crops and how low prices are until the organic guy walks in the room, then it's all about feeding the world and yield?",2017-08-25 09:09:41,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I agree with what he says but the meat, dairy and egg industry will not do that.

Better off introducing wild animals like the buffalo here in america to be on the grassland.

Tribes in Africa do not eat meat 3 times a day, if they did, they too would have to do factory farming and then there would be more Desertification.",2017-08-18 10:09:47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Some of our corn crop was really rushed into the ground (no till due to time and weather) and it is very obvious as the crop comes up that the no till was not a good idea this year. So really there is no hard or fast rule about whether no till or till is better. Proper seed bed prep is very important if optimum yields are to be reached.

I also know that levels of pesticides in our food are at levels far below any maximum levels. Organic and conventional. 
And your right, a few studies showed that some organic produce had elevated levels of some anti-oxidants. Let's not forget that you would have to eat about 5kg of strawberries to see any positive effects from these slightly elevated levels. Also, some organic milk and beef showed elevated levels of Omega Fats. The problem is milk and beef are not proper sources of Omega 3/6 fats.

I'm not sure where you come up with the ""25 or so"" number, but obviously not fromany factual sources. There are allowed products but that doesn't mean they are used, just like conventional farmers don't use all the 8000 pesticides they have access to with no oversite. Nutrient dense isnt a marketing term, it's a scientific measure of nutrients in plants. The more nutrient dense food is, the better it is for you and the less you need.

This is only one issue of many.  Kanaymycin is also used in the treatment of serious infections like TB which is on the rise and becoming resistant to other treatments.  The enzyme blocked in this apple provides natural resistance to fungal diseases.  Do people like knowing that the apples they eat are now seriously damaged but do not showing browning?  Use damaged apples for making other things like apple sauce.  This only benefits industries not the consumer.  This is not about waste.  Food waste can be addressed in safer ways.

Considering we are celebrating not only 150 years of Confederation, we are also celebrating 150 years of agriculture in Canada.  Feb 16 was the day that we should have been celebrating and acknowledging our dedicated and hardworking Canadian Farm Families.  A few excerpts from AAFC/GoC website explain it best: “Agriculture has deep roots in our nation's history, and AAFC has been there since the beginning. Did you know that the Department of Agriculture was created on July 1, 1867? At AAFC, we're celebrating 150 years of leadership in the growth, development and sustainability of the Canadian agriculture and agri-food sector.”

“Ag Facts:  Why is the agriculture and agri-food sector so important? It's a colossal contributor to the lives of all Canadians. It feeds us, as well as our economy. It employs us, and depends upon the environmental stewardship of our farmers. It is fueled by innovation and ingenuity. In short, it grows a lot more than you may think!  The agriculture and agri-food industry contributes over $100 billion annually to Canada's gross domestic product (GDP). (That's more than the national GDP of 2/3 of the world's countries).",2017-02-17 10:56:20,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0

Our potato selections are developed using traditional cross-pollination techniques between two parent plants. After 6 years of testing, the best of the best performing selections are unveiled to industry where growers have the option to trial the selections for up to two years to evaluate them for market potential. If growers want to license a variety when it’s available for license, they can place a bid and, if successful, they can develop the variety for commercial production. It’s at this point that the variety is given an official name.",2017-02-17 09:28:25,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0

The type of farm I eat my fruits and vegetables from use beneficial nematodes, bacteria and companion planting to deal with diseases and unwanted insects.  They don't till the soil which is known to destroy the beneficial organisms and microbes within soil - in return causes major infestations and all the problems that conventional farming brings. (Dead soil)   Its all about farming without using harmful chemicals that contaminate the soil for years to come and not producing toxic vegetables/fruits for humans to consume. Not killing Bee's - which we need to survive and all other beneficial insects! The type of mentality of producing the maximum and most  perfect looking food is bizarre and pure insanity! It is obviously leading this world into some very dangerous territory,  This is what is essential wrong with our ""food supply"" and anyone who thinks otherwise is grossly misinformed.

The reason it cost so much is the extreme energy input to extract sugary syrup from sap 40:1. Reverse Osmosis, the standard for big operations requires expensive equipment and electrical energy. The small operations using the traditional boiling method use a lot firewood and spend countless hours collecting from buckets. 
A small producer, I prefer the flavour wood smoke and bits of bark etc., add. RO syrup is rather bland for my taste.
Even most small producers use plastic and stainless steel cans and evaporator pans so don't worry about metal poisoning if getting yours from a small producer.

The result is a huge consentration of cow waist in their fields to an unbelievable amount. This quickly runs into all the creeks and streams making them highly toxic and killing of all but the worst bacteria ever. Soon the near by rivers and ground waters become poluted. Many farmers can no longer drink their own well water. I have seen the problem myself which is why I write about it here. There might have to be a regulation to set the number of acres per cow that a rancher needs to curb this problem.

""This spring I was privileged to visit the Africa Centre for Holistic Management (ACHM) in Zimbabwe, and spend several days with Allan Savory, the pioneer and guru of holistic management and managed grazing.

Savory is a research biologist who has faced his share of controversy over the years. And you start to get an idea of why this is so, when you hear him utter the phrase: “Only livestock can save us.” A more radical statement could hardly be uttered in this day and age. The media—from newscasts to environmental activists—all seem to agree on this one point: animals are the cause of global warming and we need fewer animals on the planet, not more, if we are to reverse desertification and restore the earth’s grasslands.
Allan unabashedly holds and expresses his radically different opinion, at every turn. I was able to talk with him and see the results of his ideas applied practically at the ACHM last May. At this learning hub in Victoria Falls, the Savory Institute staff and volunteers manage the land in a way that is sustainable and regenerative. And livestock are the tool that is turning everything around.""                                    https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/farm-ranch/livestock-can-save-us/",2017-03-22 09:02:27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1.  ""the solution to overgrazing is to manage the animals properly, overseeing their feeding patterns."" 

What precisely are you overseeing and managing that reduces the amount of plants livestock eat? The reality is 1.5 acres of land yields 37 000 pounds of plant based food which in turn will yield only 375 pounds of meat.

2. ""Animals disturb the soil just enough to stimulate new growth and then they fertilize it with their own waste. No machine can do that.""

This may be true, but there is simply too much animal waste being produced. Large quantities of it get dumped in the ocean causing ocean dead zones. Also, we don't need to be eating the animals in order for them to graze and fertilize land. 

3. ""Even if cattle put out ten times the methane they did, even if every human didn’t eat meat, we’d still have to deal with desertification on a global scale, according to Allan."" 

What? Like... what? This just makes no sense. If we stopped raising animals for food there would be fewer animals producing methane thus less methane in the atmosphere.

4. ""Reducing the number of animals on land by culling does not work, either.""

Well duh! We need to reduce the number of animals on the planet by not multiplying them not by killing the ones that already exist. 

Suffice to say your argument is absolutely ridiculous and founded on incorrect science and mistruths.",2017-03-22 11:41:04,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

First off, what mention of Methane Oxidizing Bacteria or methanatropes? None. Once again Canada seems behind. 
Next, holistic grazing, regenerative grazing, adaptive grazing, MIG, etc there are so many rotational grazing practices that more and more Canadian farmers and ranchers are picking up on these practices. These techniques allow better soil health by promoting microbial life increase, worm population increase, more glomalin in the soil and growth of mycorrhizal fungus. This allows more carbon to be sequestered into the plant and soil. 
The microbial life increase allows more methane to be broken down and faster.

There are many who engage in similar farm practices as what I do. The best studies are watching your grass grow faster and quicker than your neighbours, watch the animals get well built with healthy fur and wool coats, incredible tasting meats, fruits and veg.

It is about controlling you through food. whether i feed my herd/flock with seaweed or corn is not the issue. the issue is the giant agri-businesses controlling who eats what. I produce my own food - how many others can say the same. I don't need mega-government and agri-businesses telling me what to do on my own land. That is a form of slavery. you may wish YOUR food to be imported from far off lands - I don't. How much energy does it take to ship a live chicken from Botswana to China to flash freeze it, package it and then ship it around the world to consumers? The carbon footprint will not be lessened by letting least developed countries produce the food for first world nations but increased. As for methane emmissions changing the climate - hoakum and lies from the enviro-nuts who spread the lies to keep the cash flowing their way. At every turn the politicians, bureaucrats and mega-businesses concerns put pressure on small farmers to put us out of business altogether. They don't want competition or private land ownership.

Some people prefer to be enslaved - I'm not one of them. Stop stealing my freedoms in the name of doing good for the environment. One volcano will change the environment more in a month than a billion humans will in a lifetime. Here's a solution - stop breeding - cut the human population to 1 million people.

But the error in the calculation that livestock are worse is that for vehicles, in fairness, habitat destruction and support industry must also be factored.

For example, few people stop to think of the millions of acres chewed up to make roads, highways and parking areas.  There are whole fields of engineering and city planning devoted to just this, and the sum of destroyed land is vast.  The automotive manufacturing and maintenance industries which must mine and manufacture adds to the devastation.  The fossil fuel industry, as well as other complex chemical industries for paints, lubricants, etc., adds also to the devastation.

Either way it's very bad, though livestock have one saving grace.  When raised under more natural conditions, such as the natural grazing conditions of pre-industrial farming, they go a long way toward establishing balance in meadow environments.

The reality is that beef production needs to change dramatically and it needs to be trimmed.  People need to cut their consumption by half at least.  I don't suspect people want to be vegetarians.

Several years ago a doctor conducted a test using the MRI to examine the brains of professed conservatives and liberals. Without going into long detail, the MRI noted the neurons of the conservatives would ""fire"" on both the left and right side of the brain, indicating that conservatives tap into both the rational and emotional sections of the brain when arguing their point or expressing their views. The liberals however, tapped mostly into their emotion half of the brain and were weak in their rational section (I'm making this brief and simple). His conclusion was that extreme liberals tend to be more emotional than rational in their reactions, when arguing their points. For example, liberals want our guns taken away yet refused to give up their armed body guards. They say climate change is caused by a carbon footprint, but they still fly in their private jets leaving that same footprint they scream about. They holler for ""tolerance,"" yet are the most intolerant toward others who differ with them. On news interviews, it is the liberals who raise their voices, scream, and turn red in the race when confronted and the conservative usually sits there shaking their head, talking calm (at least in most instances).  In the recent ""woman's march,"" they women screamed, spewed hatred, used vulgarity, and made threats toward the President. When Obama was sworn in, no conservative group was burning cars, breaking glass or attacking police. In fact no conservative protest ever goes this far. It is ALWAYS and I mean ALWAYS the radical liberals. The doctor is correct. Extreme liberalism is a brain disorder and there is nothing they can do except scream, cuss, use irrational arguments that make no sense; have a double standard and remain mean spirited. This country is divided and will continue to be so, as extreme liberalism promotes extreme sins and the spirit of Jezebel is still alive in the earth. Just the other day it was reported that Trump had removed Martin Luther King Jr. bust from the Oval Office. It went viral and fed the liberal lie that Trump is racist! In fact the beautiful metal bust was on a table and a Secret Service agent was standing in front of it. Sounds like ""Fake News"" (hello CNN). He is supposed to hate immigrants, yet his wife is an immigrant, and he hired thousands of Hispanics in his construction and workplace. Thus, the irrational refuse the facts but prefer to ""fire"" on their emotional side, screaming and yelling, destroying property, to create havoc in the nation. Sounds like they need to get saved, get a renewed mind and learn to think with a saved heart and not a hard heart. We may disagree on some theories, theology, or even political ideas, but at least we conservatives use both side of our brains. - From Perry Stone Ministries",2017-03-21 05:56:29,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Savory is a research biologist who has faced his share of controversy over the years. And you start to get an idea of why this is so, when you hear him utter the phrase: “Only livestock can save us.” A more radical statement could hardly be uttered in this day and age. The media—from newscasts to environmental activists—all seem to agree on this one point: animals are the cause of global warming and we need fewer animals on the planet, not more, if we are to reverse desertification and restore the earth’s grasslands.
Allan unabashedly holds and expresses his radically different opinion, at every turn. I was able to talk with him and see the results of his ideas applied practically at the ACHM last May. At this learning hub in Victoria Falls, the Savory Institute staff and volunteers manage the land in a way that is sustainable and regenerative. And livestock are the tool that is turning everything around.'https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/farm-ranch/livestock-can-save-us/",2017-03-22 08:47:15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
