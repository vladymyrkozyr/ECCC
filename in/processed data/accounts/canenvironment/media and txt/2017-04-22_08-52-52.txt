#FBF to last year's #EarthDay when world leaders gathered in the iconic #UnitedNations General Assembly Hall to sign the #ParisAgreement on climate change.

Representatives of more than 165 countries signed the historic document at #UN Headquarters in #NYC on 22 April 2016, breaking the record for the number of signatories on the opening day of any international treaty.

Everyone in every country is affected by climate change and we all have an opportunity to do something about it. 
Climate action is unstoppable -- and will benefit ALL of us by creating jobs, saving money and improving our health. ðŸ“·: @sotonino / UN Social Media
