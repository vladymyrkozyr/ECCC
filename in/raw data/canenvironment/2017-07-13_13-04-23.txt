Arctic goose banding occurs in July and August each year, during a brief period when geese are flightless, while they replace their flight feathers. Individually numbered aluminum leg bands are attached to the birds and they are released. Subsequent encounters from hunters across North America provide information about population size, migration routes and survival of the birds and this information is critical to ensuring the long term sustainability of these species. Here, a banding crew joined force with a helicopter to herd snow geese toward a net for banding on Southampton Island, Nunavut. ðŸ“¸ Garth Ball
