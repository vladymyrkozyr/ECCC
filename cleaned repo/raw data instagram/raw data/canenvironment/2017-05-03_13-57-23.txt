Did you know that we are responsible for managing wildlife habitats at 54 National Wildlife Areas nationwide?  In the prairie provinces, habitat management sometimes includes using carefully planned prescribed burning to restore or recreate natural habitat conditions and eradicate invasive species.  In many grassland ecosystems, fire is a natural process – just like grazing – and is important for maintaining natural habitats for wildlife.
