    "caption": "The Reference Climate Station at Fort Vermillion was due for its annual inspection to ensure our sensors were within tolerance and the system was in full operational condition. After the lengthy 7.5 hour drive to Fort Vermillion, the crew was glad the weather was cooperative the following day.\n\nThis site is located at the Mackenzie Applied Research Association, which conducts numerous crop related research. We were on site for roughly 4 hours as there were several sensors that were out of tolerance and we had to replace them including our rate of rainfall, and precipitation sensors. This site is one of a few we have in Alberta that also measure soil temperatures and soil moisture. However prior to arrival the soil moisture sensors were not working. After an hour of troubleshooting and rewiring we were able to get the majority of the sensors functioning. \ud83c\udfac Braden Bunce\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#FortVermillion #Alberta #WeatherRadars #MeteorologicalServiceCanada #MaintenanceWork #WeatherStation #WeatherScience #EnvironmentCanada",
