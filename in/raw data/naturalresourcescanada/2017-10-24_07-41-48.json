A 25kW version of this turbine is being installed in the Sagkeeng First Nation Community on the Winnipeg River; 25kW could charge a medium-sized home or business. This installation also gives NRCan a chance to monitor the performance of the turbine. These turbines have also been installed elsewhere in Canada, the U.S. and India.",
