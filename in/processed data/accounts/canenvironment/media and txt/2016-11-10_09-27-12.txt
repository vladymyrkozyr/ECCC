#CoolScientistAlert  Meet Sue, a water scientist who studies harmful algal blooms, at our lab in Burlington. She has always been inspired by her work. “The diversity of field work and lab work has given me an exciting career in science.” Here she is on her home-away-from-home, the Canadian Coast Guard Ship Limnos. Sue will be retiring in December, and we wish her all the best! #ThankYou
