COOL SCIENTIST ALERT! ðŸ˜Ž

Hereâ€™s Benoit, one of our biologists studying the health of freshwater in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, using *CABIN methodology. By sampling and studying invertebrates, he can tell a lot about how healthy the freshwater is. *CABIN is the Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring Network, a network of groups working together to assess the health of freshwater ecosystems across Canada. In using CABIN methods, partners take observations using approved protocols and make scientific assessments using national standards.
