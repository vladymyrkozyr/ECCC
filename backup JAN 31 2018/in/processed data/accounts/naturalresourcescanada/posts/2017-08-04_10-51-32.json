They are proudly displaying their #GSC175 commemorative t-shirts! \nOver the last month, Nicolas and Zoik have been mapping a fault zone on Cape Breton Island that separates rocks with different geological histories on either side. By studying the fault zone in the field, and collecting samples to study in the lab, Nicolas hopes to discover when and why it formed, and how it may have created a pathway for magma deep in the Earth\u2019s crust to rise and form granite.",
