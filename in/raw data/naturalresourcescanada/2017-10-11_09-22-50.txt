The zero-emission hydrogen fuel cell Mirai produces only water as the byproduct of itâ€™s power generation.  Hydrogen vehicles can travel as far as gas vehicles on equivalent tank of gas and are just as quick to refuel!  This car is one of three currently available for purchase, and investments into hydrogen fueling stations are being made by federal and provincial governments.
