We're not kidding! In Pacific Rim National Park Reserve, you will find an open forest of trees so twisted and stunted they have taken a form of their own, and a mass of plants so thick it's impossible to see the soil beneath it. This luxurious abondance is due to rain, and lots of it, thanks to Pacific Ocean nearby. \ud83c\udf27\ufe0f Picture by @taylormichaelburk \n#parkscanada #canada #canada150 #explorecanada #explorebc #intldayofforests #internationaldayofforests #dayofforests #forestday #worldforestday #forest #rainforest #pacificrim #pacificrimnpr #hellobc #bc #conservation #rain #ocean #pacificocean #water"
