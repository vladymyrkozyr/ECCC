The engineered containment facility (or ECF) pictured here acts like a box that will store the yuckiest of sediment. When the $138.9 million project is complete in 2022, it will make the water cleaner for the fish \ud83d\udc1f & us to enjoy, and bring jobs and tourism to the local community. Hooray!!!!! \ud83c\udf89 \ud83d\udcf7: Bermingham Foundation Solutions",
