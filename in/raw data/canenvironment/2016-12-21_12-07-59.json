    "caption": "During their #snowmobile journey across the #NorthwestTerritories and #Nunavut, our climate research crew take coordinated snow measurements.\nThey found that snow cover was made up of different sized crystals with small fractions of new, recent, and icy snow. The snow was shallow (<40 cm deep), usually with fewer than six layers. Here\u2019s one of their stops at Trail Valley Creek, Mackenzie River Delta Region, Northwest Territories. \n#ArcticScience #NaturePhotography\u00a0 #NaturePhotography\u00a0 #WinterInCanada #ClimateResearch #InstaScience #ScienceofInstagram\u00a0 #CanEnvironment #Arctic #CanadianArctic #ArcticAdventures #WinterWonderland #SnowMobileAdventures #SnowmobileOfInstagram #InstaSnow #EnvironmentCanada",
