    "caption": "Rhiannon is installing a #SolarPanel to help the Automated Recording Unit operate year-round to record bird calls. #HarnessThePowerOfTheArcticSun.\n\nMaintaining the stations in the winter is much more cost effective, because there are winter roads (ice roads) in the Northwest Territories! #DrivingOnIce #WinterHighway #WinterfFeldwork\n\nNot only do the recordings tell us what birds are present, but we also learn when birds arrive to the north in the spring and when they depart for warmer southern locations. As well, there are some bird calls which are difficult for the human ear to pick up, especially if other birds are calling at the same time (e.g. Ruffed Grouse); these units allow us to record ALL the sounds, including the tricky quiet ones #WeHearYouBirds.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#CanadianWildlifeService #NorthwestTerritories #BirdNerds\n\n#WildlifePhotography #EnvironmentCanada #BiologistsLife #BiologistsOfInstagram #CanEnvironment #FieldWork #InstaScience",
