Just like the sun, we rise everyday with the chance to try something new and to aim for the sky. Whether it be running on an empty beach at dawn or climbing a mountain, you can do anything with the time you were given today! 
Great picture taken by @Ivoryorphan in Prince Edward Island National Park.
