I flew higher than the sky 25 years ago but I am no bird. Who am I? 
Dr. Roberta Bondar, the first Canadian female astronaut!

Dr. Bondar joined Becky from Canadian Wildlife Service and other researchers on Country Island to capture the beauties of this spectacular place. Connecting people with nature through arts is now among her goals with the Roberta Bondar Foundation.

Only 5 km offshore of Guysborough County NS, this little island is home to the largest known colony of Roseate Terns in Canada.
