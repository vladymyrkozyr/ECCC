The rough terrain includes risks to humans like grizzly bears and fast-moving water. The trail is also a designated contaminated site, due to elements leftover from an old pipeline constructed during the Second World War. 

Recently, a contract was awarded to Englobe Corp. (NWT) to clean up the trail. Remediation of the trail will reduce risks to people, animals and the environment associated with the abandoned pipeline and related infrastructure. This remediation project will benefit the local economy and provide job opportunities to the Sahtu communities.
