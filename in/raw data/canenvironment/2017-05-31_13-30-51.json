    "caption": "A Swainson\u2019s hawk was sitting on a fencepost, eating its prey (a northern pocket gopher) when I stopped well back to have a look.  Although I used a telephoto lens and was trying not to bother it, after stripping off and gulping a few bits of meat from this headless snack, the hawk decided it wanted to nosh the rest without an audience, and took off (dramatically) to find a solitary perch.\n\nSwainson\u2019s Hawks show up for our prescribed fires.  Once the smoke starts rising, Swainson\u2019s will be attracted to forage for mice/voles/shrews who have no more grass cover to hide in.  We\u2019ve seen as many as 9 or 10 hawks in one area that has been recently burned.\n\nOver 300  species (301 at the last official count) use the Last Mountain Lake National Wildlife Area for breeding (180 species) and passing through on migration.\n\nPeople like Kerry monitor nesting success of these large hawks at the LML NWA.  Come and see for yourself at our open house June 8 2017 2-6pm\n.\n.\n.\n. \n#EnvironmentCanada #BirdOfPrey #MigratoryBirds #ProtectedAreas #ProtectedArea #CanadianWildlifeService #CanadianWildife #Saskatchewan #WildlifeConservation #WildlifePhotography #ExploreCanada #OpenHouse #MigratoryBirdSanctuary",
