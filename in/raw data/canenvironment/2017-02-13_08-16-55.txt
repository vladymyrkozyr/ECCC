This is our home away (in Edmonton, Eastgate offices) from home (our HQ is in Gatineau, QC). The building has a gold LEED rating for human and environmental health. Canadian Wildlife Service, the Enforcement Branch, the Prairie and Arctic Storm Prediction Center, the Canadian Meteorological Aviation Center and Air Quality all work out of this building.
