Here is one of the most deceptively delightful predators in #NorthAmerica: The Fisher.

Fishers are among the most effective land carnivores, especially given their size. Porcupine is their favourite prey! That’s one prickly meal.

Here we see one hopping over and marking our bait stick (the scent glands are located in the rear). Then it’s off to investigate our camera as they click away.
