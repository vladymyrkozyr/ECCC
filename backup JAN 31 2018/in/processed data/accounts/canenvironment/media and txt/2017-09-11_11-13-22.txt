Monarch enthusiasts found a tiny monarch caterpillar on a milkweed plant during a Mission Monarch workshop.

We hosted the workshop which was hosted by the Montreal Insectarium at our Big Creek National Wildlife Area in July. This event had an amazing turnout, participants got to see presentations on the Monarchâ€™s biology, threats and declines, and the details of the Mission Monarch monitoring protocol. Participants had the opportunity to practice what they learned on the property, where they were thrilled to find several milkweed plants with Monarch caterpillars and eggs.
