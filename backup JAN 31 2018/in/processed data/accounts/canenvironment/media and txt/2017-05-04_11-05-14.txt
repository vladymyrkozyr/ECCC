What a cool blast from the past! 
Canadian Wildlife Service biologist Ron Mackay examines a Trumpeter Swan in the 1950s. In 1933, because of hunting and harassment, there were only 77 Trumpeters in Canada and 50 in the US. Today, as a result of an intensive international conservation effort, there are about 16 000 wild Trumpeter Swans, and the species is no longer considered in danger of extinction.
