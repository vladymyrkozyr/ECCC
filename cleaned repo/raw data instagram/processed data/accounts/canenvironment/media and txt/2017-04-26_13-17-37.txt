Meet Anthony Levesque – Anthony is from Guadeloupe. He is a dedicated bird biologist with his own birding business now. In the past he was with various agencies in his home country working with hunters and government to implement protection measures for species at critical times of the year to help reduce the impact of hunting on their populations. Shorebirds look completely different in the winter – so Anthony is used to identifying them more from their shape and sound than when they are in their breeding plumage in the arctic and are easier to identify. Arctic-breeding shorebirds spend most of their life cycle outside Canada, so it is fantastic when we get to cooperate with our international colleagues. In this photo, the twin otter is loaded up and the survey team is about to head to the tundra!
