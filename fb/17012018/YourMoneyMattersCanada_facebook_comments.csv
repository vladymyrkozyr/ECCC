However, many retailers uphold the Scanner Price Accuracy Voluntary Code which is endorsed by the Competition Bureau of Canada. The code includes the Item Free Scanner Policy which stipulates: if an item scanned at checkout is a higher price than advertised by the store or displayed in the store, the lower price will be honoured. Also, if the correct price of the product is $10 or less, the retailer will give the product to the customer free of charge; or, if the product is over $10, the retailer will give a discount of $10 off the correct price. 

The next time this happens to you, ask if the retailer upholds the code. You can learn more about the Scanner Price Accuracy Voluntary Code here: https://www.retailcouncil.org/scanner-accuracy [[SHARE]]",2017-08-23 13:14:05,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0

150 years of murder, oppression, assimilation and genocide towards the indigenous tribes and native peoples that already resided here LONG before it became a country. 

This country was founded on lies & betrayal. üíØ 
There is an ugly part of our history that must not be swept under the rug.  

At least 6,000 indigenous children died while in the residential school system.

Residential schools were established in the 19th century as a colonial strategy to ""take the Indian out of the child"" and destroy indigenous cultures.  It was nothing short of an attempt at cultural genocide.  The last schools didn't close until 1996. 

The legacy of the abuse experienced by these innocent children in Canada's residential schools is extensive. Over the century that they operated, indigenous children aged five to 16 were forcibly taken away from their families and subjected to horrific psychological, physical, spiritual and sexual abuse, leaving a legacy of dysfunction that has been passed down to the second and third generations.  Some children who attended the schools in the 1940s and 1950s were even subjected to science experiments in which they were deprived essential nutrients and dental care.  

The first step is for all Canadians to understand what happened and what the schools did to indigenous peoples.  The second step is committing that we will support action to ensure the repair of damages done. 
Social, Economic and Environmental Terrorism being perpetrated upon the Original Peoples of this land is the ongoing agenda of the colonial governments regardless of their political ideologies in the political spectrum.

They are having a REVENUE CRISIS, because they have no ideas how to spur anything. This government thinks a successful economy can be based on , taking money from me, and giving it to Juanita and Farsi to spend, in the name of Child Benefit cheques. 
So, they will harass a few bucks out of already overtaxed employees in response to their abysmal failure, and tax cigs and alcohol more, because Johnny Lunchpail still has a few bucks left over for a night of relaxation once in a while.

Islam is not a religion, nor is it a cult. In its fullest form, it is a complete, total, 100% system of life.

Islam has religious, legal, political, economic, social, and military components. The religious component is a beard for all of the other components.

Islamization begins when there are sufficient Muslims in a country to agitate for their religious privileges.

When politically correct, tolerant, and culturally diverse societies agree to Muslim demands for their religious privileges, some of the other components tend to creep in as well.

Here‚Äôs how it works.

As long as the Muslim population remains around or under 2% in any given country, they will be for the most part be regarded as a peace-loving minority, and not as a threat to other citizens. This is the case in:

United States ‚Äî Muslim 0.6% 
Australia ‚Äî Muslim 1.5% 
Canada ‚Äî Muslim 1.9% 
China ‚Äî Muslim 1.8% 
Italy ‚Äî Muslim 1.5% 
Norway ‚Äî Muslim 1.8%

At 2% to 5%, they begin to proselytize from other ethnic minorities and disaffected groups, often with major recruiting from the jails and among street gangs. This is happening in:

Denmark ‚Äî Muslim 2% 
Germany ‚Äî Muslim 3.7% 
United Kingdom ‚Äî Muslim 2.7% 
Spain ‚Äî Muslim 4% 
Thailand ‚Äî Muslim 4.6%

From 5% on, they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population. For example, they will push for the introduction of halal (clean by Islamic standards) food, thereby securing food preparation jobs for Muslims. They will increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature halal on their shelves ‚Äî along with threats for failure to comply. This is occurring in:

France ‚Äî Muslim 8% 
Philippines ‚Äî Muslim 5% 
Sweden ‚Äî Muslim 5% 
Switzerland ‚Äî Muslim 4.3% 
The Netherlands ‚Äî Muslim 5.5% 
Trinidad & Tobago ‚Äî Muslim 5.8%

At this point, they will work to get the ruling government to allow them to rule themselves (within their ghettos) under Sharia, the Islamic Law. The ultimate goal of Islamists is to establish Sharia law over the entire world.

When Muslims approach 10% of the population, they tend to increase lawlessness as a means of complaint about their conditions. In Paris , we are already seeing car-burnings. Any non-Muslim action offends Islam, and results in uprisings and threats, such as in Amsterdam , with opposition to Mohammed cartoons and films about Islam. Such tensions are seen daily, particularly in Muslim sections, in:

Guyana ‚Äî Muslim 10% 
India ‚Äî Muslim 13.4% 
Israel ‚Äî Muslim 16% 
Kenya ‚Äî Muslim 10% 
Russia ‚Äî Muslim 15%

After reaching 20%, nations can expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia formations, sporadic killings, and the burnings of Christian churches and Jewish synagogues, such as in:

Ethiopia ‚Äî Muslim 32.8%

At 40%, nations experience widespread massacres, chronic terror attacks, and ongoing militia warfare, such as in:

Bosnia ‚Äî Muslim 40% 
Chad ‚Äî Muslim 53.1% 
Lebanon ‚Äî Muslim 59.7%

From 60%, nations experience unfettered persecution of non-believers of all other religions (including non-conforming Muslims), sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia Law as a weapon, and Jizya, the tax placed on infidels, such as in:

Albania ‚Äî Muslim 70% 
Malaysia ‚Äî Muslim 60.4% 
Qatar ‚Äî Muslim 77.5% 
Sudan ‚Äî Muslim 70%

After 80%, expect daily intimidation and violent jihad, some State-run ethnic cleansing, and even some genocide, as these nations drive out the infidels, and move toward 100% Muslim, such as has been experienced and in some ways is on-going in:

Bangladesh ‚Äî Muslim 83% 
Egypt ‚Äî Muslim 90% 
Gaza ‚Äî Muslim 98.7% 
Indonesia ‚Äî Muslim 86.1% 
Iran ‚Äî Muslim 98% 
Iraq ‚Äî Muslim 97% 
Jordan ‚Äî Muslim 92% 
Morocco ‚Äî Muslim 98.7% 
Pakistan ‚Äî Muslim 97% 
Palestine ‚Äî Muslim 99% 
Syria ‚Äî Muslim 90% 
Tajikistan ‚Äî Muslim 90% 
Turkey ‚Äî Muslim 99.8% 
United Arab Emirates ‚Äî Muslim 96%

100% will usher in the peace of ‚ÄòDar-es-Salaam‚Äô ‚Äî the Islamic House of Peace. Here there‚Äôs supposed to be peace, because everybody is a Muslim, the Madrases are the only schools, and the Koran is the only word, such as in:

Afghanistan ‚Äî Muslim 100% 
Saudi Arabia ‚Äî Muslim 100% 
Somalia ‚Äî Muslim 100% 
Yemen ‚Äî Muslim 100%

Unfortunately, peace is never achieved, as in these 100% states the most radical Muslims intimidate and spew hatred, and satisfy their blood lust by killing less radical Muslims, for a variety of reasons.

‚ÄòBefore I was nine I had learned the basic canon of Arab life. It was me against my brother; me and my brother against our father; my family against my cousins and the clan; the clan against the tribe; the tribe against the world, and all of us against the infidel. ‚Äî Leon Uris, ‚ÄòThe Haj‚Äô

It is important to understand that in some countries, with well under 100% Muslim populations, such as France, the minority Muslim populations live in ghettos, within which they are 100% Muslim, and within which they live by Sharia Law. The national police do not even enter these ghettos. There are no national courts, nor schools, nor non-Muslim religious facilities. In such situations, Muslims do not integrate into the community at large. The children attend madrases. They learn only the Koran. To even associate with an infidel is a crime punishable with death. Therefore, in some areas of certain nations, Muslim Imams and extremists exercise more power than the national average would indicate.

Today‚Äôs 1.5 billion Muslims make up 22% of the world‚Äôs population. But their birth rates dwarf the birth rates of Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews, and all other believers. Muslims will exceed 50% of the world‚Äôs population by the end of this century.
(Latest population percentages as of 2008)
