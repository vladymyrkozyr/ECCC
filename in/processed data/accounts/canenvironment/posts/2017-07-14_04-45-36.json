The success of the bird banding program relies on reports of bird bands from the public. Data from recovered bands are essential for our researchers! Bands identify individual birds so that we can better understand their movements and it provides us with important information for managing bird populations. \ud83d\udcf8 Garth Ball\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#BirdBanding  #CanadianWildlifeService #InstaBird #BirdConservation #BiologistsOfInstagram #EnvironmentCanada #EnvironnementCanada #SnowGeese #FieldWork #MigratoryBirds #BirdMonitoring #CanadianWildlife #Canada",
