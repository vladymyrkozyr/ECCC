Apple cider is raw apple juice that hasn’t been filtered to remove pulp and sediment. It starts to ferment in about a week, so it’s mostly a seasonal beverage. Pasteurization can extend its shelf-life but can also make it taste bitter.

Apple juice starts out as apple cider and is then filtered to remove pulp and sediment. It can take up to 20 hours to filter really clear apple juice! But not anymore.

She carried out thousands of experiments at Ottawa’s Central Experimental Farm, largely using a large dehydration tunnel built in 1942. Her research greatly improved the appearance and nutritional value of commercial dehydrated vegetables.

A testament to her achievements, Dr. MacArthur was the first woman to be named as a Fellow of the Agriculture Institute of Canada.
