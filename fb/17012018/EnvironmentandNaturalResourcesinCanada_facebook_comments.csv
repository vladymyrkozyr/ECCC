Carbon rebates are given to the lowest income class people. The government leads you to think if you are getting a carbon tax rebate that the impact is minimal. However, it is a direct tax on the middle class, those that need cars, families that need to Eat, and seniors that Require Services. It is the most pervasive tax that simply lines the coffers of provinces and the federal government. The Carbon tax penalizes the middle class because it is them that are spending that drives the economy, and it also may be a mechanism for the redistribution of wealth to the lower classes. The tax was envisioned by a socialist leader who is willing to ethically compromise himself for the Muslim faith and the Aga Kahn, whom he is given middle class tax payers money to, and fully promotes Trudeau, no fewer then 13 times in press releases. We know the elite don’t pay tax, Morneau ethic’s violation resulted in ill gotten money being contributed to his wife’s charities (Another was to skirt paying taxes, why did he just pay the tax and come clean), these elite leaders all have private trust funds to avoid taxes.

Diminished brain resilience syndrome is a term coined by the lead author to describe a particular physiological state of nutrient functional deficiency and disrupted homeostatic mechanisms leading to increased susceptibility to previously considered innocuous concussion. We discuss how modern day environmental toxicant exposure, along with major changes in our food supply and lifestyle practices, profoundly reduce the bioavailability of neuro-critical nutrients such that the normal processes of homeostatic balance and resilience are no longer functional. Their diminished capacity triggers physiological and biochemical ‘work around’ processes that result in undesirable downstream consequences. Exposure to certain environmental chemicals, particularly glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide, Roundup®, may disrupt the body's innate switching mechanism, which normally turns off the immune response to brain injury once danger has been removed. Deficiencies in serotonin, due to disruption of the shikimate pathway, may lead to impaired melatonin supply, which reduces the resiliency of the brain through reduced antioxidant capacity and alterations in the cerebrospinal fluid, reducing critical protective buffering mechanisms in impact trauma. Depletion of certain rare minerals, overuse of sunscreen and/or overprotection from sun exposure, as well as overindulgence in heavily processed, nutrient deficient foods, further compromise the brain's resilience. Modifications to lifestyle practices, if widely implemented, could significantly reduce this trend of neurological damage.

This peer review process is meant to curb publication of flawed research. Séralini had spent two years and more than $3 million working with seven other scientists to study how the genetically modified corn and the herbicide impacted the animals’ health. At the time, Séralini was also president of a scientific advisory board that worked with a group opposed to GMOs. He believed there were potential problems with GMOs and Roundup that had not yet been uncovered by the scientific research that was largely funded by the chemical industry. Séralini and his team had seen troubling results in previous studies, including evidence that Roundup herbicides containing POEA along with glyphosate were much more harmful than glyphosate alone, causing cell damage at levels expected to be found in food.5 Groups of rats were evaluated by the Séralini team in the 2012 study. The rats were divided into males and females. Some were fed genetically engineered corn; others consumed corn sprayed in the field with Roundup; and others were given Roundup in drinking water in different doses, with the lowest corresponding to levels found in some tap water. The intermediate dose was set at the maximum level permitted in the United States in animal feed, and the highest dose was correlated to half the strength of Roundup as used in agriculture. Control group rats were fed a diet containing non–genetically engineered corn and plain drinking water. The Séralini study results were alarming. Treated rats had much higher death rates than the control group animals, and the exposed rats demonstrated an “unexpected increase in tumor incidence,” especially mammary tumors in female rats, along with damage to the animals’ livers and kidneys. The scientists said both the GMO corn and Roundup contributed to the health problems that developed in the experimental animals, and they said they found “unexpected low dose toxicity from Roundup” at levels 10,000 times lower than those permitted in drinking water in the United States.6 The study results “clearly indicate that lower levels of complete agricultural G [glyphosate] herbicide formulations, at concentrations well below officially set safety limits, can induce severe hormone-dependent mammary, hepatic, and kidney disturbances,” the study authors concluded.7 Séralini said his research gave credence to fears that Roundup contains ingredients more toxic than glyphosate and that Roundup formulations should be considered endocrine disruptors.

Dr. Mona Nemer says: ""Science is not about beliefs and opinions. Science is about facts. Please be engaged, continue asking questions, participate as much as you can. It will all make us stronger.""

Well, here's a question based on facts: why isn't anyone looking into what Wolbachia-infected Aedes releases are doing to our food chain and specifically vertebrates?

Are we going to foolishly cling to Hertig's 1936 results on mice and chicken embryos? Or, are we going to acknowledge and devote resources to testing vertebrates (including humans) for the presence of Wolbachia?

Because here are facts that are being willfully ignored:

The direct effect of Wolbachia can either impede or promote the pathogen's replication and survival (Zug and Hammerstein, 2015). Examples of neutral or pro-pathogenic effect of Wolbachia include: Brugia pahangi (Dutton and Sinkins, 2005); Japanese encephalitis (JE) Virus (Tsai et al., 2006); Drosophila C Virus (Osborne et al., 2009); and Plasmodium gallinaceum (Baton et al., 2013).

Re: Sexual Transmission of Zika

There is commonly held belief that Zika is rarely a sexually-transmitted disease. However, ""up to 47 percent of ZIKV cases in Barranquilla, with 95 percent confidence, may have been due to sexual contact alone."" Source: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436516300330

North Atlantic right whales are highly promiscuous (as are some humans).

Over 28,000 cases of Zika were reported in Puerto Rico as of Oct. 26th, 2016. The waters surrounding many islands in the Caribbean are obviously teeming with Zika-infected Aedes and Culex mosquitoes, eggs, and larvae. Eventually, Cal fin and krill will be nibbling away at them. 

So, the major food source of North Atlantic right whales will also be exposed to the Zika virus and Wolbachia — both are maternally inherited.

There are multiple ways these whales could be infected with Wolbachia and/or Zika.

Bottom line: These whales (and many marine mammals, shorebirds, and humans) are being exposed to inordinate amounts of Wolbachia (a reproductive parasite).

When I asked Dr. Daoust about Zika, WNV, SLEV, and Wolbachia, he replied weakly that these whales were in various states of decomposition, downplayed the likelihood of a mosquito biting them and so these were not even considered; nor tested for.",2017-10-06 05:47:06,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Since land area of cities and large towns containing these weather stations only make up a very small fraction of the total land area, this influence on global average temperature data is significant. Since the daytime and nighttime temperatures are combined to form an average, these artificially-raised nighttime temperatures skew the average data. When one only looks at daytime temperatures only from larger urban areas, the “drastic global warming” is no longer visible.

Greenland had the coldest ever July temperature recorded in the north hemisphere. Yeah ... if you believe human activity is responsible for global warming and the catastrophic events ... hurricanes fires floods etc ... you might think its our fault ... except your belief is not substantiated by facts. There are not now more or worse hurricanes floods fires than have occurred in the recent past. You need only look at the data. The only difference is we've been fighting forest fires for over 50 years instead of letting it burn as nature intended ... now you get a fire and there is no way to put it out because of the fuel that has accumulated ... so in this way humans are responsible for changing the natural fire cycle for one that is worse ... but thats not the same as saying its due to anthropogenic climate change when there is no evidence to support it.,2017-09-20 21:05:32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A few ideas were test out a neighbourhood or village and built it without cars inside it. Outside yes cars can be there. But use Henry Fords idea on soybean/hemp cars and gas. It worked completely as well is Eco friendly. 

That village or neighbourhood would be built using all natural resources. All recycled plastic would be put into building parts as well anything else Eco friendly. I kinda drew out a plan with it but unfortunately I have no money to try out the ideas. If it worked other places can adapt to be somewhat similar. I also heard the Ford company is making trains powered by magnets. If that was made it would cut back a lot on problems. 

Hemp can also replace literally anything made out of plastic. I know plastic doesn't go away for over 800 years... So it would be useful. I do also know seaweed can replace what cows typically eat. Which helps not just the cows health but also the environment.",2017-05-05 16:43:49,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1. Introduce tougher fines for people who litter
2. Put into place stronger laws and regulations to stop businesses from polluting our environment -land, water and air (I'm not talking about a carbon tax here)
3. Expand existing protected lands, conservation areas, parks and waterways at the municipal, provincial and federal levels 
4. Create NEW protected lands, conservation areas, parks & waterways
5. Encourage volunteers to get more involved with protecting our environment. Ie. cleaning up parks and planting trees
6. Help make the public more aware of ways to be environmentally friendly on a daily basis. Ie. commuting, recycling
7. Offer even greater incentives (rebates/tax credits) for electric car purchases and initiatives to make homes more energy efficient / energy independent (solar panels, geothermal, wind mills) 
8. Pursue clean, renewable energy sources in both the public & private sector (hydro power, solar, wind, geothermal)
9. Introduce tougher laws that protect all species of animals in Canada
10. Stronger laws protecting against logging / clear cutting of trees

A lot of these ideas are budget friendly or are investments that will save people, businesses and government money in the long term from energy savings!",2017-01-25 21:59:44,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Firstly in the GTA there aren't feasible methods of public transportation to get into the city unless you are commuting right downtown, and a commuter culture is always going to be the reality when property in Toronto is so expensive, because of this many people drive with no real alternative. Secondly, on a daily basis I see so many people with disposable water bottles. Why not encourage people to use reusable water bottles by placing water bottle refilling stations in public areas like train stations, and subway stops. Or even going further and having those locations be ""water bottle free"" where businesses and vending machines located within these areas don't sell bottled water and instead there is access to refill stations. Lastly is diet, everybody has been saying it, but as far as I know the Canadian government invests in cattle farming. These are just obstacles that I see that could be improved to help people change their lifestyles, are there areas that the Canadian government is working to help every person have a lifestyle with less of an environmental impact?",2016-11-23 11:26:27,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

2 trillion+ in debt.
The debt is sold on the us and London stock exchange.
Foreign bidders win the opportunity to extraCT as much oil n gas n minerals as they can then pawn their shares back on the market.
They bring in their own temperate foreign workers and avoid hiring locals.

The public funds and union pensions and band council trust funds get invested through she'll holdings in the Isle of man and Panama and then reinvested through companies like Petronas and the Malaysian government.
Those entities  establish offices in other countries like China. 
Then negotiate deals with those regions to provide resources that they speculate they can extract from Canada. 
Then they ""negotiate"" agreements with the provincial and federal government of Canada for resource extraction and return the embezzled money to the politicians and lawyers who in turn ""invest"" that money to the private contractors and holdings that were involved in originally structuring the fraudulent scheme in the first place.

Then we blame the Chinese when in actuality it's our own so called government to blame and those corporate offices may be located in China however it is not the Chinese who are at fault.

And then we blame the less fortunate in our society for living off tax dollars and meanwhile our hard working middle class is taxed upwards of 50% from their paycheck to pay off the Queens mortgage.

Yet and still bc has a soaring debt getting close to a trillion dollars and the Federal government claims a debt beyond 2 trillion.

Meanwhile tiny little Switzerland boasts revenue surplus in the area of several trillion dollars annually through tourism revenue.

The west coast has the potential tial to generate even greater profits through a properly managed tourism industry that is eco friendly and at the same time would create a massive and permanent job creation and labour market.

Without the need for taxation. 

All this could be obtained by the mainstream population under the jurisdiction of unceded tribal nations and then everyone would have lots of money, lots of time to spend with loved ones, opportunity to travel and to enjoy life, free fish and free food.

Incorporate free energy technologies with our knowledge of natural medicines and nutritional food values and reduce unhealthy circumstances.

Countries like China and India are manufacturing building supplies that can build a skyscraper in less than 30 days and Taiwan has built skyscrapers designed to grow food already.

Meanwhile the BRICs are developing a system that allows for travel without the need for passports and a more viable banking system than the imf.

But....what do I know? 
I'm just a tree hugging hippy with a bunch of useless ideas.

Get back to work everyone.

Even though modern technology can potentially see a world that only requires 10% of the population to work while everyone else celebrates their freedom to do whatever, we should categorize such a concept under banners that we have been taught are bad.
Freedom is not good remember, unless you are killing somebody.

P.s.
Canada is not even a country nor an ethnicity.  It's a white supremacist corporation owned by the British crown in London which is owned by northern Europeans who pose as Germans.  Follow the clues.  Norway bankrolled Rome when Rome designed the famous railways system and communication network that was in turn handed over to hitlers regime to conduct the Holocaust of Europe. 
When Hitler figured that out he turned on the northern Europe coalition responsible. 
When he did the Norway royals fled to Ontario where they stayed in a little town that is now called ""little norway"" because of this snafu.
After the secret allies of fascism in North America and Europe publicly revolted against the Hitler regime in response, suddenly we are told that he is bad even though we were helping him to become what he was before he bit the hands that fed him.

When Hitler fell many of his highest ranking officers relocated to Canada where they assumed advisory positions to the crown and continued their global subjection racket with a primary focus on first nations people.
Same formula.  Same purpose.

Anyways...back to work.  We got a crown debt to pay.  And don't give any money to beggars because it's their own fault they are compromised right?

The vast majority of homeless people came from foster care.  The vast majority of inmates at correctional facilities came from foster care.

Is it the foster care administration who are directly responsible for manufacturing a crime rate and poverty market?

The vast majority of foster children are first nations therefore can it be safe to suggest we are still witnessing genocide right in plain view?

Nevermind.  Nothing we can do about it.
It's not like Iceland demonstrated it can be done without violence...or did they?",2016-06-07 12:50:14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Randy Pompetti is the author of the note below. He lives in Hanna, Alberta, Canada

My fellow Canadians, you are buying into a lie regarding our energy industry and the global environment. We are a mere 35 million people, just 0.5% of this planet’s 7.3 billion population. Our country covers roughly 10 million square kilometres of which probably 90% is realistically uninhabitable (explaining why over 80% of our population live in urban centres within 200 kms of the U.S. border)

We endure temperature extremes ranging from -40C or colder to 35C or warmer. Out of necessity we need to heat our homes for 6+ months the year. We face major transportation challenges simply because of the geography of our country. Yet, through all this we are responsible for less than 0.5% of the pollution generated globally.

We ARE NOT the problem! If every one of us here in Canada chose to sacrifice ourselves for the betterment of mother earth and self-terminated, the positive effect on the global environment would be…..drum roll please……zero!

The global effect would actually be negative because we are one of the most ethical, environmentally responsible producers of energy in the world! If we were out of the picture the U.S. would be mining our oil sands before our corpses had even started giving off methane gas. They would then proceed to build the biggest pipeline imaginable, from Fort Mac to Texas.

Don’t believe me? Let’s look at some facts. The U.S. has no problem with pipelines; U.S. pipelines that is. They actually have over 3.2 ‘million’ kilometres of liquid petroleum and natural gas pipelines already. There’s also the 1300 kilometre, 122cm (48 inch) line running from Prudhoe Bay to the Valdez Marine Terminal (yes, big bad oil tankers). You are aware, aren’t you, of the Trans Alaskan pipeline running directly through the pristine heart of that beautiful state?

As of 2010, 16 ‘BILLION’ Barrels of oil had been transported through this U.S. pipeline and terminal. The U.S. also has no problem drilling for oil in the Atlantic ocean, the Pacific ocean, the Arctic ocean or the Gulf of Mexico yet they have the audacity to condemn Canada for mining our oil sands in northern Alberta and Saskatchewan?

The opposition to our Canadian energy development is a well-organized attempt to keep our Canadian oil land locked so that we are forced to sell to the U.S. and to the U.S. only and then at a very discounted price. The U.S. is attempting and succeeding in preventing us from marketing our own natural resources globally to the highest bidder. U.S. foundations (HP, Tides – THE ROCKEFELLERS – et al) are funding the opposition to our oil sands and contrary to popular belief it has absolutely nothing to do with threats to the environment.

If they really were that concerned about our planet why are they not protesting the real polluters, the real threats to our environment? China, the world’s worst polluter (besides having a tragic human rights record)? No protests.

Why isn’t David Suzuki over in Beijing chastising Jinping? What about the other major polluters? Russia? The U.S. themselves? India? I can understand a Canadian that is benefiting financially, who is receiving grants to oppose or protest or hamstring our own resource development. What I can’t understand is the rest of my fellow Canadians buying into their bovine excrement.

In the oil sands, our very own Canadian oil sands, we have the 3rd largest proven crude oil reserve in the world, behind only Saudi Arabia and Venezuela – again, both with ‘stellar’ human and women’s rights track records. EVERY person in Canada, and EVERY province and territory in Canada has benefited tremendously, whether directly, indirectly or both from our oil sands development.

Over the next 25 years the oil sands has the potential to generate over $1.5 TRILLION in federal and provincial taxes and royalties. Of course Quebec will need their share – but, oh yeah, they don’t want a pipeline either! There is the potential for well over 500,000 direct and indirect jobs.

So here’s the deal my fellow Canadians. I fear our Canadian ‘goose that lays the golden egg’ is suffering the death by a thousand cuts. Alas, it may already be too late. Maybe it’s already on life support. If you share the views of the Gore’s, the Suzuki’s, and the Obama’s of the world, that our Canadian energy producers and those that work in this industry are bad and evil and a scourge on the Earth, a blight on Canada’s reputation in the global community then fine, stick your fork into the goose as well but please do not whine and complain 10 or 15 years down the road when the wait time for your hip replacement is 3-5 years because our health care system is underfunded and there’s a severe shortage of doctors and nurses in the system. Meanwhile, the Suzukis and their ilk will be flying down to the Mayo clinic in a big bad fossil fuel burning jet for their medical needs.

Don’t whine and complain when your grandchild’s class has a 50:1 student to teacher ratio because our education system is underfunded and the government coffers are bare. Of course the Suzuki grandchildren will be in private schools so no problem there. Don’t whine and complain when your city’s infrastructure is decaying and falling apart and there’s no money to repair it. Instead of whining and complaining, make sure you look into the mirror and realize you believed a lie that has cost this incredible country and our future generations an amazing opportunity to prosper and succeed globally.",2016-06-12 07:16:04,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

One of the locations it recommended to discuss suggestions for the development of an Environmental Action Plan was your facebook page. 

I've been researching this issues for over 3 decades. During that time I have found thousands of different solutions to this problem from brilliant people all over the world.

I respect the complex nature of this issues as it related to the economy and the various regional concerns. One thing is very clear and that is the burning of greenhouse gas emitting fuels must end.

It is my hope those industries effected can be repurposed to reduce the negative impacts of the transition.

Having said that there is one very obvious solution that meets and exceeds all of your stated requirements.

""Seawater"" it is the most abundant greenhouse gas free fuel on the planet. It is readily available for use. It is extremely clean & safe to use.

All of our existing combustion engine technology is capable of burning it with small modifications. 

Most important, many other options exist which do not require burning it at all to power all our energy requirements.

One benefit to burning seawater is the byproduct. Freshwater H20.

I would purpose that Canada should start manufacturing ""seawater powered turbine generators"" for electricity production. 

Secondary benefit is freshwater production / conversion.

Third benefit would be to help reduce the impacts of sea level rising by converting the seawater into freshwater.

Forth benefit : Existing combustion engines can be used to Hydrogen as a replacement fuel similar to propane.

Finally, This is not rocket science. People are already doing with worldwide. 

The real economic benefit here for Canada is doing it better than everyone else.  We can do this.

This technology would be outstanding for North communities as they can utilize both seawater, fresh water & snow to power their homes 365 days per year.

This would help Canada better utilizing its land and claim that territory by occupying it more effectively.

Below is a number of videos outlining said technology and some additional more advanced electron based uses of seawater.

I hope this has been helpful in any small way & would be happy to provide additional links or reference material if required.

Regards,

Marc Santos

It isn't even owned by the English people.
It's listed on the us and London stock exchange and the 2 trillion dollar debt is being sold in bonds.
Foreign investors purchase these bonds hoping to extract more oil n minerals than their investment and they bring in their own foreign temperary workers and meanwhile we have a few organized crime syndicates embezzling domestic union funds and public purses through offshore holdings especially since 5 years ago when the American banks restructured to parallel the Canadian model to synch their fraud.

People who call themselves Canadian....are getting completely screwed by the pirates and sure the imf collects royalties and licencing fees.

Anyways.  There's a way out.  Foreclose on this corporation they registered called Canada and for a republic.
Republic means no monarchy.

Why the heck should anyone on this continent take responsibility for paying the mortgage on Buckingham Palace? 

Especially our trades people are being jumped the worst.  Many of them pay upwards of 50% of their paycheck in taxes just for it to be funneled to the queen, and they spend most of their time away from family and loved ones on jobs that permeate their job site with so many toxins they die of cancer by the time they retire.

Good for the money laundered because then instead of collecting pensions all their dues go to faulty investment ts in the Phillipines. 

Yeah.  Dissolve Canada.   It'll be good for business.",2016-05-25 09:12:20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

On behalf of the Right Honourable Justin Trudeau, I would like to
acknowledge receipt of your correspondence. 

Thank you for writing. The Prime Minister welcomes the views of
Canadians on the issues that are important to them, whether supportive
or critical. You may be assured that your comments and suggestions have
been duly noted and are appreciated.

Once again, thank you for taking the time to write.

You can Help the World meet the Paris Agreement, Reduce smog worldwide,
Increase Trade employment, Give First Nations an opportunity to succeed,
and cover the expenses created with Federal Revenues with ONE activity!

We have a global problem we all need to address and Canada can play an
important role in solving this problem. 

The world  population grows, is using 19th century energy sources (coal)
to generate electricity to fuel their desire for a North American
lifestyle.

Starting now, we as Canadians can provide a cleaner burning alternative:
Natural Gas. This fuel  in its newer form will help us all transition to
a 21st century of entirely renewable energy sources.

We all share this beautiful planet and we need to work together on
practical solutions to this global problem. If we keep fighting over the
solutions we will not move forward.

And speaking of working together - here in BC we have government
representatives, industry, northern community residents and First
Nations Bands engaging in meeting the issues!

If there is an area that Canadians shine at its our excellence in - its
ethical industry operating in compliance - demonstrating environmental
stewardship excellence. 

One of these solutions is clean burning Canadian Natural Gas which can
now be exported Globally in the Liquefying process and is known as LNG.

Did you know the US (via Alaska) has been exporting Liquefied Natural
Gas to Japan for 50 years. 

But of course you have the data it's been on the Federal Government
Website for years : Please see Policy Horizons Canada The Role of
Infrastructure in Integrating Asia's Regions at
http://www.horizons.gc.ca/eng/content/role-infrastructure-integrating-asias-regions written by Jean-Phillip Veilleux.

It has all kinds of handy sources for helping make good decisions
including pipeline distribution maps in Asia. 

Perhaps it's time for Canada to join the world in supplying this cleaner
fuel? We have an abundance of it and the taxes generated will help us
all. It will tackle deficits, It will cover programs. LNG It will
generate opportunity for First Nations in employment and opportunity, It
will put people back to work, it will help the middle class. It will
improve the debt to GDP ratio. It will reduce world emissions. It sound
like an opportunity to meet so many of the Liberal Campaign promises!

Help us teach and reach the world with our economically viable, safely
transportable, readily available, thermally efficient ""super fuel"". It's
a mouthful but if you say it makes you smile!

Please clear the way for this green solution we will stick with the
science but we can't let excessive bureaucracy and gerrymandering tie us
up any more.

Counting on you, 

James Klassen

By electrifying everything and using a combination of onshore and offshore wind, residential and commercial solar, utility-scale solar, geothermal, wave, tidal, and existing hydroelectric, we'd reduce all-sector end-use power demand by ~43% and create more jobs than lost. His team recommends 80% conversion in all-sectors by 2030 and 100% by 2050. His peer-reviewed roadmaps offer policy measures to enable this transition.

The Oil Climate Index helps shed light on what this could mean for Canada's oil sector.

A barrel of Athabasca DC SCO (736kg CO2 eq/barrel) would see a price hike of $36.80/barrel.

If this tax applies to extraction, it will render any plans for expansion of the tar sands much less profitable in any long term financial analysis. This could effectively kill any projects without the government having to stop them on regulatory grounds. Same logic could apply to fugitive emissions stemming from Lelu methane export terminal.

Renewables are not self-sufficient, not economical, are expensive, not capable, do not have capacity! Green NEEDS oil to survive! Green requires RARE Earth Minerals that are RARE and will get less abundant and MORE costly!

Why are we wasting time on them, instead of successfully optimizing our Canadian Advantage???

We need politicians with GUTS to do the RIGHT thing for Canada, not the LEFT thing!!!

The Governments should also issue their Citizens two cards. #1 says 'I support fossil fuels', #2 says 'I do not support fossil fuels'. You can only sign one of them! But in order to use a Highway, or get gas at the pump, or propane for your BBQ, you MUST have a signed #1 card! That will weed out many hypocrites! What card is in our PM and Premier's Wallet?

1) The world energy consumption continues to grow, and a large majority of that is with fossil fuels.

2) Canada has amongst the largest reserves of these, and this business has been no.1 in terms of GDP,  govt revenues, and employment in this nation. Nothing comes close until maybe now.

3) Coal produces about 215 lbs/MMBTU of GHG (on the avg), and Natural Gas produces 117 lbs/MMBTU. The switching of fuel from all coal to gas in the world would reduce GHG emissions by nearly half (some 6 Gtn's). Gas burning has much less Nox's and SO2's and technology for CCS (Carbon capture and sequestration) is greatly facilitated. Research allocation to this topic would be well spent if it was done.

4) Large scale wind and solar projects, subsidized by govt's the world over are....challenged. Both technically in terms of delivering adequate amounts of power when needed with adequate uptime, and economically (people and industry are paying very much more for their power). The efforts have so far raised the cost of living for the poor, at the benefit of the company's being subsidized to deliver wind and solar..

5) Allowing individuals to make their own choices for 'greening' their way of life is much more likely to have more success due to the detail that is involved in deciding priorities, and what best serves the interest of that individual. Indeed society is made up of individuals, is it not?

6) Canada contributes 1.7% of the worlds GHG, not accounting for any CO2 absorption from our vast forests and lakes, and land. Does everyone consider it sensible we curtail our competetiveness in the world O and G market? Do you really believe we can make a difference by performing self-flagellation of our oil and gas industry?

7) If one were to review the details of the well barrier standards that are in place today in the Danish sector of the North Sea, you will observe they are carbon copy of the Canadian ones. I know this because I put them there. Canada has second to none engineering and operating standards, and these are partly (at least) in place in every place where I have been employed.

8) Oil production involves the production of methane when gas comes out of solution. Many Opec countries do not bother with this off-gas and just either burn or vent it. Likewise produced water in many Opec countries is treated very minimally before being disposed of back into the environment. Canada and its Canadian engineers and operators do their work with an astronomically higher standard of ethics than what I have seen and witnessed in my experience working abroad. Stop demonizing the quality engineering of your own compatriots. This is very wrong!

9) Unlike wind and solar, Canadian oil and gas industry IS NOT subsidized. Unlegislated tax not being collected cannot be categorized as a subsidy.",2016-04-21 11:30:56,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0

But it seems so slow from here; where's the urgency and audacity that your young audience feels? And where's the progress on reducing subsidies to fossil fuels? Sure, Alberta is hurting, but it still doesn't make sense to continue them while simultaneously proposing carbon pricing.   On subsidies, it's so murky, everything from the IMF's estimates, to declarations from government that they are already reduced or gone, nobody even knows what subsidies are today, so claims of reducing them aren't comparable to a base line. Emissions targets are equally muddy - 30% of some date by some date. The only one that people really understand is zero by 2050, committed to in Paris.This translates to 3% per year from today for 33 years.  So track progress against a simple target annually and report on it honestly even if we miss. The Paris target is probably not good enough to achieve 2 degrees, and 2 degrees is probably not good enough to avoid catastrophe, but I can dream that if we start with that and it turns out not to be as hard as some fear then we can go faster. I know you don't want to be the minister with no power, but you can't compromise with physics.

Check out wind power in Germany,  Australia or even Ontario, it is not viable yet.  Too intermittent and dilute,  impossible to control the power grid with them connected.  Same problem with solar. Also both have a larger environmental footprint by the time they're installed including attainment of raw materials,  processing,  manufacture, and maintenance (clearing ice from the blades with helicopters and for solar the low amount of sun during winter) Also both only last 20 years or less in our climate. Natural gas fired power has a 50 yr. life. That's beside the fact that current wind turbine design is poor and each one kills thousands of predatory birds and bats every year. 
Wind and solar cost much more than they ever return in value. If wind and solar are ever to be viable it would be on a micro rather than macro scale. Each new building could have both but battery technology must be improved.
Geothermal a real possibility but large enough installations haven't been tested yet. 
Natural gas is still the best,  least expensive,  plentiful, very low emissions and very controllable. It can be supplemented with CCS. 
BUT CO2 emissions are not really that much of a concern.  Anthropogenic CO2 only makes up 0.12% of the GHGs in the atmosphere and Canada as a whole contributes only 1.7% percent of that. More than 99.6% of GHGs is naturally occurring and we have no control over them. Also Canada's vast Boreal forests currently are a carbon sink that absorb more CO2 than we emit. 
Ruining our economy for this insignificant amount of CO2 in these circumstances is a fool's errand. Governments and the UN have another agenda and a larger political purpose for pushing the climate change fears.  
The current  CO2 concentration is around 400 ppm and is barely above the 200 ppm required to support most plant life. The concentration has been as high as 1200 ppm in earth's past and coincidentally that is the same concentration that many greenhouses maintain for optimum plant growth. 
Controlling climate change is arrogance,  just like saying we can control earthquakes! Even so reducing our CO2 emissions is probably not a bad thing although probably not worth the costs but could be a consideration in the design of buildings and all fossil fuel burning equipment in the future.",2016-04-22 10:08:46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It has been estimated that just 7% leakage is enough to make Natural Gas equivalent to coals emission levels. I would remember why Ontario has been so successful eliminating coal. Nuclear Energy at 60% an hydro at 25% made that transition possible. Stan your solution will likely be exatcly what will take place in Alberta. Natural Gas not the least harmful of three evils.

For the past 30+ years every pipeline project has been met with fierce organized resistance. The Socialists have done everything possible to ensure that they would not obtain approval. Three things have made this fairly easy for them to accomplish.

First is they paint the proponents as Big Bad Oil & Gas Corporations that are only concerned about making obscene profits. This allows them to  paint themselves as the protectors of everyday normal people who somehow need their interventionist protection. And it diminishes the reality of thousands of normal hardworking people who would benefit from all the opportunities that an expanded market access would provide. 

Second is they fund and incite Indigenous communities to join them in opposing the ""rape and destruction"" of their traditional lands. This is often accompanied by an all out effort to portray all the ongoing problems within some remote communities as the fault of prior industry misdeeds. Rather than openly and honestly looking at the many failures of the Socialist Entitlement experiments which lead Indigenous People away from self sufficiency into a downward spiral of dependence. The worst part of utilizing communities in this manner is it creates difficult to resolve adversarial positions from years of protests and blockades. And it never addresses the root cause of distrust, namely that such communities simply never get an opportunity to work in a mutually beneficial partnership with industry.

Third is the way in which the Socialists portray themselves as the only protectors of wildlife and habitat. They organize mass kayak blockades never realizing the hypocrisy of flying thousands of people to jump in petroleum derived plastic kayaks while paddling thru waters rife with the raw sewage discharge of one of their ""enlightened"" enclave cities. They glorify a  living off the land lifestyle while conveniently ignoring the fact that killing of animals for fur and sustenance is our history.  And clearing of land to build our homes, raise our crops and yes, build our villages as part of our rightful place on earth.

So how do we as ordinary citizens counter these three ingrained socialist pipeline resistance strategies? It really is quite simple.

Rather than have a big corporation as the pipeline proponent, form a citizen owned (NOT GOVERNMENT! ) private company to own, propose, develop, build and operate the pipeline project. With ownership limited to citizens from the territories involved and no big money only shareholders. Establish it with tens of thousands of residents within the proposed pipeline route being holders of shares from a $100 to at most $10,000. This makes it a small-c capitalist project that people can relate to as family, friends and neighbors. Not a faceless corporation only looking to the bottom line.

Next up is to ensure that the Indigenous People along the route are also individual shareholders who stand to benefit alongside all the other owners. With open access to all the opportunities that might accrue within their traditional land areas. Working alongside another man or woman is the best way to learn that you have so much more in common with them than not. Desire for a better life for your respective families being the most common bond shared by all cultures. And a shared pride in building something together becomes a generational bond that transcends many past perceptions.

The final requirement is to exhibit the utmost respect for the environment, biodiversity and wildlife at every stage of a proposal. Point out the fact that even the ""green"" wind and solar projects contain risks for wildlife that have to be mitigated. And then follow through, don't take shortcuts simply to reduce costs, work with the best practices that have been proven to reduce adverse environmental impacts. Better is always possible, pursue it!

A citizen owned project as described above would not need nor should it seek ANY government subsidy or involvement. The regulator and approval bodies would find it EXTREMELY difficult to turn down any appropriately developed proposals. How could they say no to such a CITIZEN initiative? Doing so would lead to total rejection at the next election.

I have spoken with citizens and Indigenous groups across several possible routes to Pacific tidewater access. They are just as supportive as many of us here in Alberta to get something moving. The 2-3% foreign backed Canadian Socialists have worn out their welcome as people everywhere awaken to the reality of failed economies that resistance to responsible developments delivers.  At this point routes from Alberta thru the Northwest Territories, Yukon, Alaska and lately even British Columbia are supported by real people throughout.

We can sit still and wait for the Rest Of Canada to figure out that they really do need our money. Or we can unite and push forward with projects with our own Social License, not dependent upon their sanctimonious approvals. If you're interested in staying apprised of such a citizen initiative, just email me. And ask your family and friends to do the same. Rachel's NDP government isn't interested in anything but wind and solar. In two days Justin formally signs the COP21 agreement which includes the LEAP Manifesto objectives! Rachel and her NDP cronies have already agreed to everything LEAP asks for, read the agreements for yourself. 

China, India and Southeast Asia are expanding their Petroleum appetite by over 20 Million barrels per day over the next 25 years. Let's make sure that our children, grandchildren and great grandchildren are shipping our refined products where it's wanted!

BTW, one of the first investments the Citizen's Initiative could pursue is the game changer Carbon Capture technology that's a  reality today. Our synthetic crude oil could become the lowest carbon footprint resource worldwide. That's what happens when someone puts an obstacle in front of Albertans. We turn it upside down and create another Alberta Advantage! As this technology advances we will also see Coal return as the low emissions low cost leader. Albertans will be traveling worldwide to oversee the installation of this made in Alberta technology. 😉

It is in Ottawa so I can't attend. do you have any plans to have similar events across the country so you can have a real consultation. since  I can't attend I would like to share some of my opinions on the subject.

1. We need to educate ourselves on the issue.During the past regime we were fed so much disinformation. It is still happening. There are lawsuits starting against oil companies for their organized disinformation campaigns. Perhaps we should participate or do something to stop the flow of bad information.

2.We need to stop building more infrastructure for fossil fuels. Why? Canada is a high cost producer and as such we need to run not walk away from this industry as fast as we can just from a business point of view. To get ourselves to zero carbon by 2050 we need to reduce our fossil fuel consumption by 6% compounded annually or 3% in absolute terms. This is doable but difficult. to get it done requires a very good plan and no going back to old ways.

3.We need to set up our tax structure so that living and doing business in the core of a city is rewarded. We cannot build an energy efficient society if we keep subsidizing the flight ot the suburbs. For example a building in the city core should get a tax credit,near the core should be tax neutral and in the suburbs should have a surtax to pay for the cost of power lines ,water lines,roads ,snow removal ,police ,lights and all the services that cost more as you go further out.

4.Many towns and cities have sources of waste heat that are not being used. In my little city of Edmundston there is a pulp and paper mill that gives off enough waste heat to the water and air to heat all the buildings in the area and to heat all the hot water in the area. We could stop burning wood and oil and save a lot of electricity.

5.Canada needs a national light pollution law. Lighting uses 25% of all electricity and is growing at 5% to 7% per year. The lighting industry tries to get us to believe that all of this light is helping our safety and security. The science is starting to show that it is hurting us and other organisms on the earth.

6.One of the answers to employment provided by energy sector is to put people to work cleaning up the mess of abandoned oil wells,oil tanks and coal mines. Many of these people are tradespersons who could also go to work building a new clean energy infrastructure.

7.We need to get our investment dollars out of fossil fuels. The Canada pension plan invests the money of all Canadians. As such it should be directed by the government to support our polices and get our money out of fossil fuels. There should be clear ,clean non fossil fuel options for people investing in RESP and RRSP.

8. Canada's foreign aid should be going to help poor countries like Dominican Republic and Haiti move from generating electricity using diesel generators to wind and solar power.

9. I notice that your government has budgeted 3 billion to help First Nations. This is only a fraction of what they need.One part of the isue with remote communities is that they mostly get electricity and heat from fossil fuels. encouraging them to go renewable would help their dollars to go further and might provide other opportunities for them.

10.Farming uses a lot of fossil fuels. Do we have a strategy for our agricultural sector to become less fossil fuel dependent? Efficiency? Carbon sequestration in soils? Removing the rural power grid as farms become larger and rural power grid becomes too expensive to maintain for such a small population.

11. What is our strategy on transportation? Cars? Trains for people and freight? Truck transport? Ships? Airlines?",2016-04-22 08:44:34,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

There is a serious lack of understanding about energy, even more so about nuclear energy. The industry is maligned and misrepresented by those willing to ignore what science has achieved. These same people who don't take the time to investigate seem willing to sacrifice the well being of the planet over irrational fears of radiation. If the goal of science is to make a better future then we need to look at what is economical and what is healthy for the planet. Coal dominates as the largest energy source not only killing people but much land and ocean life. Nuclear energy is an abundant and clean energy source that outperforms other energy sources per unit of fuel. People like the Dalai Lama, James Hansen and countless scientists who support nuclear energy indicate that acceptance of nuclear is a matter of education.

Climate scientists and ecologists who endorse nuclear energy are calling on us to action to prevent climate change. Many pronuclear advocates started as environmentalists and have concluded that to prevent the threat to species extinction and quality of life issues that nuclear energy is the only zero greenhouse gas emissions energy source that can be scaled fast enough and robust enough to be able to replace the abundant energy coal currently provides. The unavailable raw materials needed for wind and solar and the risks of natural gas leakage from gas plants that always get added to compensate for intermittent wind and solar makes the so-called ""all of the above"" solution impractical. Facts that are misrepresented and ignored.Ontario replaced its coal plants because nuclear energy provides 60% of Ontario’s electricity and Hydro provides 25%. 

Radiation is everywhere and has always been with us. Mammals and all Earth's species have evolved and been equipped to handle radiation naturally. The media coverage that implies Fukushima and Three Mile Island had or could still have fatalities are lies and the exaggerations about Chernobyl's victims with outrageous numbers being perpetuated by the media's awareness that fear sells.
