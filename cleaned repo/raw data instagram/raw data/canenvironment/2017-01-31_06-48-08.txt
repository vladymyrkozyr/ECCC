Biologists Paul  and  wildlife technician Regina are lucky enough to work out of the Goose Bay office. Last February, they had the chance to visit the Inuit community of Makkovik while hosting community workshops on how to identify bird wings.  This project is a Stewardship project in collaboration with  Nunatsiavut Government  and modeled after a project called National Harvest Survey.
