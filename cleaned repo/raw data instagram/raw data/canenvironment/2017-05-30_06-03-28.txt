Nature is everywhere including in your schoolyard, backyard and outside your community center. One of our employees took this shot during lunch time…we’re all surrounded by beauty, we only have to observe! This World Environment Day (Monday June 5th), or any day this June, teachers, youth program leaders and parents can help young people discover the nature around them by bringing them outside for a mini-Bioblitz.!
