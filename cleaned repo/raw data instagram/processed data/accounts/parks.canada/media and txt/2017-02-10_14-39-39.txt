Kootenay national park is a place of unique contrasts, from icy mountain rivers to steamy hot springs. 
Not only can you admire this #WinterWonderland ❄️️, you can also visit exhibits at the Kootenay national park Visitor Centre illuminating the fascinating cultural and natural heritage of the park and the Columbia Valley – with a special focus on local Ktunaxa First Nations culture. 
Thanks for the photo @stevint 😊
