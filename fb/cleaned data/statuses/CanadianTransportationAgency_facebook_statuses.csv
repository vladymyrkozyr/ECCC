We were pioneers of net neutrality... In , the Board of Railway Commissioners assumed jurisdiction over Canada's early telephone and telegraph toll charges. And in , the Board ruled that the CP, which was operating a telegraph news service, was using discriminatory pricing by charging a higher price for delivering messages that originated with other news services. In the telephone industry, a similar principle was used when Bell Telephone, which had a monopoly in a large part of Canada, was prohibited from providing content-based services. The Board's ruling established a basic principle of Canadian telecommunications - the separation of control of message content from control of transmission - an early eression of what is now called ""net neutrality"".

Consequently, we turned to the Canadian Transportation Agency for assistance. Their service was amazing- very thorough, very comprehensive and very attentive. The first contact elained the passenger tariff and our rights as passengers. We took the next step and asked CTA to mediate on our behalf, which fortunately turned out to be a successful exercise.
