He\u2019s combing the drill core for fractures and faults, using many different techniques to understand when these structures were active. \nDating the movement of these structures and the timing of hydrothermal fluids that circulated through them will help us learn how and when these uranium deposits formed.\n\n#Faults #geochron #RockClock #NotMyFault #fieldwork",
