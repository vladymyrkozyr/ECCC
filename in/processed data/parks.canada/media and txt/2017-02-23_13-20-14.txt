Even in the middle of a white infinity, our chairs always stand out as the perfect place to relax after a great effort. Winter is quite simply magical in Waterton Lakes National Park. Although the park is usually asleep under a thick blanket of snow, the temperature is mild, thanks to warm Chinook winds!
Thanks for the pic @betamanic!
