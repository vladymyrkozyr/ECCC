    "caption": "Have you heard of Climate Action 150? It\u2019s a project funded by a contribution agreement we have with GreenLearning Canada.\n\nClimate Action 150 gives students a voice in building a low-carbon and prosperous Canada and an opportunity to present and engage with the Government of Canada.\n\nToday,  in a Virtual Town Hall, more than 400 high-school students from across the country discussed climate change with our minister, Catherine McKenna, as well as with Mary McGrath, Executive Director of GreenLearning and host Terry Godwaldt, from the Centre for Global Education. Students presented action plans on three topics \u2013 Greening Our Energy Supply, Sustainable Transportation, and Reducing Waste. Students will continue to take action \u2014 in their daily lives, at school and in their community while challenging others to act.\n\nWhat's YOUR #ClimateAction?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#Climate150 #Canada150 #WEDCan #ClimateChange #Canada #EnvironmentCanada #CanEnvironment #LowCarbon #CanadianYouth #YouthClimateAction #ActNow #CANClimateAction",
