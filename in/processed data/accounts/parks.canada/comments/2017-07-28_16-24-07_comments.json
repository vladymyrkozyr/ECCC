        "text": "@tangru1si520 Fair enough.  And I can imagine that, being local, it may also bias you a bit, as you see that type of mixed boreal landscape much more often than most. To be fair to the park, though, there are LOTS more than only one lake! Waskesiu is just the one beside the little town. The last trail I hiked was on the south end of the park, and it was beautifully maintained, nice and wide, too, and I passed several lakes before reaching the one I camped at, Fish Lake. This little campground was also well maintained. Just throwing the suggestion out there that it may be worth giving another chance. :)",

There is only a lake in this park and the hiking trails are lacking of maintenance. I can say that even a BC provincial park is better than PA NP. I'm a local Saskatchewanian I live in Saskatoon. I'm so glad you love this park but, tbh, it's really not my thing. Sorry bud.",

They are stunning, absolutely... But why would you wish to say such a thing about Prince Albert NP? It is extraordinarily beautiful, unique, was the first place I ever back-country camped (a life-altering experience), and was the place Grey Owl himself chose to make his home for many years... I really don't believe your comment is at all warranted! Have you ever truly explored this park?",
