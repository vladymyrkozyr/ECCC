Carbon rebates are given to the lowest income class people. The government leads you to think if you are getting a carbon tax rebate that the impact is minimal. However, it is a direct tax on the middle class, those that need cars, families that need to Eat, and seniors that Require Services. It is the most pervasive tax that simply lines the coffers of provinces and the federal government. The Carbon tax penalizes the middle class because it is them that are spending that drives the economy, and it also may be a mechanism for the redistribution of wealth to the lower classes. The tax was envisioned by a socialist leader who is willing to ethically compromise himself for the Muslim faith and the Aga Kahn, whom he is given middle class tax payers money to, and fully promotes Trudeau, no fewer then 13 times in press releases. We know the elite don’t pay tax, Morneau ethic’s violation resulted in ill gotten money being contributed to his wife’s charities (Another was to skirt paying taxes, why did he just pay the tax and come clean), these elite leaders all have private trust funds to avoid taxes. The middle class carry the tax burden of this country. Morneau showed Canadian even when you get caught, you don’t need to adhere to ethical standards there is always a way to avoid paying the TAXES.",2017-12-26 09:38:52,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,25-34

Diminished brain resilience syndrome is a term coined by the lead author to describe a particular physiological state of nutrient functional deficiency and disrupted homeostatic mechanisms leading to increased susceptibility to previously considered innocuous concussion. We discuss how modern day environmental toxicant exposure, along with major changes in our food supply and lifestyle practices, profoundly reduce the bioavailability of neuro-critical nutrients such that the normal processes of homeostatic balance and resilience are no longer functional. Their diminished capacity triggers physiological and biochemical ‘work around’ processes that result in undesirable downstream consequences. Exposure to certain environmental chemicals, particularly glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide, Roundup®, may disrupt the body's innate switching mechanism, which normally turns off the immune response to brain injury once danger has been removed. Deficiencies in serotonin, due to disruption of the shikimate pathway, may lead to impaired melatonin supply, which reduces the resiliency of the brain through reduced antioxidant capacity and alterations in the cerebrospinal fluid, reducing critical protective buffering mechanisms in impact trauma. Depletion of certain rare minerals, overuse of sunscreen and/or overprotection from sun exposure, as well as overindulgence in heavily processed, nutrient deficient foods, further compromise the brain's resilience. Modifications to lifestyle practices, if widely implemented, could significantly reduce this trend of neurological damage.

Publication in a journal such as FCT requires a lengthy process in which experts unrelated to the study review it and can ask questions and seek revisions before it is published. This peer review process is meant to curb publication of flawed research. Séralini had spent two years and more than $3 million working with seven other scientists to study how the genetically modified corn and the herbicide impacted the animals’ health. At the time, Séralini was also president of a scientific advisory board that worked with a group opposed to GMOs. He believed there were potential problems with GMOs and Roundup that had not yet been uncovered by the scientific research that was largely funded by the chemical industry. Séralini and his team had seen troubling results in previous studies, including evidence that Roundup herbicides containing POEA along with glyphosate were much more harmful than glyphosate alone, causing cell damage at levels expected to be found in food.5 Groups of rats were evaluated by the Séralini team in the 2012 study. The rats were divided into males and females. Some were fed genetically engineered corn; others consumed corn sprayed in the field with Roundup; and others were given Roundup in drinking water in different doses, with the lowest corresponding to levels found in some tap water. The intermediate dose was set at the maximum level permitted in the United States in animal feed, and the highest dose was correlated to half the strength of Roundup as used in agriculture. Control group rats were fed a diet containing non–genetically engineered corn and plain drinking water. The Séralini study results were alarming. Treated rats had much higher death rates than the control group animals, and the exposed rats demonstrated an “unexpected increase in tumor incidence,” especially mammary tumors in female rats, along with damage to the animals’ livers and kidneys. The scientists said both the GMO corn and Roundup contributed to the health problems that developed in the experimental animals, and they said they found “unexpected low dose toxicity from Roundup” at levels 10,000 times lower than those permitted in drinking water in the United States.6 The study results “clearly indicate that lower levels of complete agricultural G [glyphosate] herbicide formulations, at concentrations well below officially set safety limits, can induce severe hormone-dependent mammary, hepatic, and kidney disturbances,” the study authors concluded.7 Séralini said his research gave credence to fears that Roundup contains ingredients more toxic than glyphosate and that Roundup formulations should be considered endocrine disruptors.

I was able to get through to one Governor, although I reached out to seven. I received quite a bit of feedback sending out to public sites in California this week. I encouraged everyone to share my idea, hopefully, this will reach the CA Governor office with enough strength to pressure him to give it a try. I'm pretty low on the food chain, but if his office hears from the public, maybe he'll listen. In the mean time,  I wonder if I could enlist you to forward & share my message with as many people as you can. Especially any environmental groups or people in Government, who would like to see a reversal of the quantity of wildfires and scorched earth. I'm not very sure of the best paths to pursue in Canada, but I'm trying multiple paths in the USA. Thanks for your feedback and support.  LK",2017-10-13 06:42:41,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,35-44

Dr. Mona Nemer says: ""Science is not about beliefs and opinions. Science is about facts. Please be engaged, continue asking questions, participate as much as you can. It will all make us stronger.""

Well, here's a question based on facts: why isn't anyone looking into what Wolbachia-infected Aedes releases are doing to our food chain and specifically vertebrates?

Are we going to foolishly cling to Hertig's 1936 results on mice and chicken embryos? Or, are we going to acknowledge and devote resources to testing vertebrates (including humans) for the presence of Wolbachia?

Because here are facts that are being willfully ignored:

The direct effect of Wolbachia can either impede or promote the pathogen's replication and survival (Zug and Hammerstein, 2015). Examples of neutral or pro-pathogenic effect of Wolbachia include: Brugia pahangi (Dutton and Sinkins, 2005); Japanese encephalitis (JE) Virus (Tsai et al., 2006); Drosophila C Virus (Osborne et al., 2009); and Plasmodium gallinaceum (Baton et al., 2013).

Re: Sexual Transmission of Zika

There is commonly held belief that Zika is rarely a sexually-transmitted disease. However, ""up to 47 percent of ZIKV cases in Barranquilla, with 95 percent confidence, may have been due to sexual contact alone."" Source: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436516300330

North Atlantic right whales are highly promiscuous (as are some humans).

Over 28,000 cases of Zika were reported in Puerto Rico as of Oct. 26th, 2016. The waters surrounding many islands in the Caribbean are obviously teeming with Zika-infected Aedes and Culex mosquitoes, eggs, and larvae. Eventually, Cal fin and krill will be nibbling away at them. 

So, the major food source of North Atlantic right whales will also be exposed to the Zika virus and Wolbachia — both are maternally inherited.

There are multiple ways these whales could be infected with Wolbachia and/or Zika.

Bottom line: These whales (and many marine mammals, shorebirds, and humans) are being exposed to inordinate amounts of Wolbachia (a reproductive parasite).

When I asked Dr. Daoust about Zika, WNV, SLEV, and Wolbachia, he replied weakly that these whales were in various states of decomposition, downplayed the likelihood of a mosquito biting them and so these were not even considered; nor tested for.",2017-10-06 05:47:06,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,25-34

Since land area of cities and large towns containing these weather stations only make up a very small fraction of the total land area, this influence on global average temperature data is significant. Since the daytime and nighttime temperatures are combined to form an average, these artificially-raised nighttime temperatures skew the average data. When one only looks at daytime temperatures only from larger urban areas, the “drastic global warming” is no longer visible.

I think this issue has a great deal to do with our relatively extravagent (on average) lifestyles: if one believes human activity is a major contributor in global warming, ocean acidification/dead zones, air/water/land pollution, greatly accelerated species extinction, etc, etc, then one cannot help but feel somewhat responsible.",2017-09-20 18:22:15,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,35-44

The interesting bit is that temperatures are on average cooler this summer ... even as BC was warmer and drier as normal. Greenland had the coldest ever July temperature recorded in the north hemisphere. Yeah ... if you believe human activity is responsible for global warming and the catastrophic events ... hurricanes fires floods etc ... you might think its our fault ... except your belief is not substantiated by facts. There are not now more or worse hurricanes floods fires than have occurred in the recent past. You need only look at the data. The only difference is we've been fighting forest fires for over 50 years instead of letting it burn as nature intended ... now you get a fire and there is no way to put it out because of the fuel that has accumulated ... so in this way humans are responsible for changing the natural fire cycle for one that is worse ... but thats not the same as saying its due to anthropogenic climate change when there is no evidence to support it.,2017-09-20 21:05:32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,45-54
