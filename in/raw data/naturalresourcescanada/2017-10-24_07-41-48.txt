Hereâ€™s another #CleanTech innovation that was featured at the #GenEnergy forum.

This is the EnCurrent hydrokinetic turbine.
This turbine is ideal for power generation in remote communities. A 25kW version of this turbine is being installed in the Sagkeeng First Nation Community on the Winnipeg River; 25kW could charge a medium-sized home or business. This installation also gives NRCan a chance to monitor the performance of the turbine. These turbines have also been installed elsewhere in Canada, the U.S. and India.
