The Battle of the Windmill in 1838 was part of the complex struggle for control of the British colony of Upper Canada. Downstream from Prescott but within sight of the town, the stone windmill that became the focus of the Battle of the Windmill in November 1838 still stands. Visit this site where the struggle and hopes of a nation in creation still resonate through the stone.
