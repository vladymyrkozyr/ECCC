Scientists from around 10 agencies and institutes from all over the world are currently working together in the Arctic to measure ice on land and sea. This is one of the largest Arctic expedition ever! 😲This huge collaborative international effort will help ensure the ice-thickness maps created from satellite data are correct. We have a small crew over there that will be sharing photos and highlights (when they have access to the Internet 🤦🏽‍♀️). Check our account to follow their adventures! 🙃
