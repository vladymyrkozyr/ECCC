    "caption": "Would you believe these pictures were taken back to back? \nOne of our scientists working at the Eureka Weather Station in Eureka, Nunavut, went for a morning walk. Due to the moon being in its waning phase, the sun and the moon were clearly visible at the same time. The waning moon rises during the night, is visible in the morning, and sets during the day. After capturing this cool shot of a muskox and the moon, she turned around and saw a beautiful sunrise. \ud83d\udcf8: Renee Cossitt.\n.\n.\n.\n#Sunrise #InstaSunrise #Wildlife #CanadianWildlfe #Eureka #Nunavut #EnvironmentCanada #EnvironmentCan #ExploreCanada #FridayFeeling",
