Julie and a number of Canadian Wildlife Service biologists from our Sackville, New Brunswick office were in the field last week helping out with the annual Cape Tormentine Christmas Bird Count.  The annual Count is one of the largest citizen science projects in North America; the results help provide information about the status of bird populations.  These brave employees faced brisk arctic-like winds to record 58 different species! ðŸ“¸:Garry Donaldson
