The grizzly bear is normally a solitary animal, but not today! After all, nothing beats a bear hug on #NationalHuggingDay.

This adorable picture was taken in #GlacierNationalPark in Canada. The dense forests of the park allow for populations of large mammals, birds, and alpine species. Visit it this year!
