Gwaii Haanas means "islands of beauty" in the HaÃ¯da language, and is world renowned for its cultural heritage and natural splendour. We're proud to cooperatively manage the area with the Council of the Haida Nation, from mountain top to seafloor. A highlight of your visit will be meeting the Haida Gwaii Watchmen at any or all of the five ancient Haida village sites within Gwaii Haanas. #NADCanada ðŸ“·: @creeks.and.peaks .
