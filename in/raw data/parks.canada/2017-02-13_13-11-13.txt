Massive throwback today: Skoki Ski Lodge was Canadaâ€™s first ski lodge!

A rare and little-changed link to the early days of ski tourism, Skoki Ski Lodge is a fine example of the log building traditions long associated with the Banff region. When it opened for business in 1931, skiing was just emerging as a major form of winter recreation across Canada.
