The wilderness of central Saskatchewan – grasslands, boreal forests, rolling aspen parkland and pure lakes – meets accessibility in Prince Albert National Park. Canoe in a network of lakes and streams, camp in aspen and tamarack forests and see wildlife like rare plains bison and white pelicans, making the experience as wild or relaxing as you like.
