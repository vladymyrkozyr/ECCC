They can clog intake structures in power stations and water treatment plants and cause millions of dollars in damages. Zebra Mussels are found throughout all the Great Lakes. 

They are an average of 2-2.5 cm, reaching up to 4 cm long, triangular in shape, and are black or brown with white to yellow zigzagged patterns. If you think you‚Äôve seen or caught a Zebra Mussel where they are not known to occur:
*Do not release it into the water.
*Catch it and keep it frozen. If you can‚Äôt do that, destroy it.
*Note the location (with GPS coordinates if possible) as well as the observation date.
