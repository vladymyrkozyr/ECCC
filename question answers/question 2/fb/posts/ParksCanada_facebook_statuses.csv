1) No or very little coordination is required. It’s simple to learn for all ages!
2) Little preparation time needed before leaving on a hike.
3) There’s low risk of injury and it’s easy on joints.
4) It’s a superior calorie-burner - about 500/hour.
5) It provides a great legs and buttocks workout - and arms too, if you add poles.
6) You can explore out-of-the-way places.
7) Snowshoeing is inexpensive - especially compared with other winter sports.

As part of a landscape restoration project at Georgian Bay Islands National Park, staff needed to find out if bats were taking up residence in an old maintenance shed. The park’s Resource Conservation team used an ultrasonic acoustic detector and found Little Brown Bats sleeping in the building. They were able to determine exactly when the bats moved out in the fall, so while the bats were away for winter vacation down south, staff installed 'bat boxes' all around the area so they had nice new homes to move into when they returned in the spring. #BatWeek","Happy Halloween!

Kenow Fire Information Update – Unified Command: September 11, 2017; 19:15 

FIRE MOVEMENT AND BEHAVIOUR 
• Fire is now firmly established in the Cameron Valley along the Akamina Parkway. 
• There is also fire in the Tamarack Basin which is expected to grow and move into the Blakiston Valley and towards the Red Rock Parkway. 
• We continue to monitor the fire progress. 
• Structural protection units will be activated if necessary. 
• Extensive infrastructure and facility protection is installed within the townsite including high volume pump and sprinkler systems around the perimeter of town. 
• Highways 5 and 6 are now closed at the boundaries of Waterton Lakes National Park. 
• We are expecting similar weather and intense fire behaviour tomorrow. 

SMOKE 
• Intense fire behaviour is generating significant smoke. Wind direction and temperature inversions may result in low-lying smoke in areas north of Waterton, especially at night. 
• Exercise caution while driving in the area, especially at night. Check AB 511 for driving conditions. Speed limits or closures may be put in place. 
• Wildfire smoke affects people differently. People with pre-existing health conditions or sensitivities to air pollution are at risk of worsened symptoms from smoke exposure. For smoke and air quality alerts visit: www.airhealth.ca 

WHAT’S OPEN AND CLOSED… 
• Waterton Lakes National Park is Closed: www.parkscanada.ca/waterton-kenow-fire 
• Calgary Forest Protection Area south of Highway 532 is Closed: http://srd.web.alberta.ca/calgary-area-update
