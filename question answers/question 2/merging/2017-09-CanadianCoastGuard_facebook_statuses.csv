They left a time capsule, ashore, beside one of the benchmarks that they used during the survey. It contained a full crew list and a list of the names of the hydrographic team. Byron Briggs, the current Commanding Officer of CCGS Henry Larsen, was part of that 1997 crew list as the Second Officer. The time capsule was later discovered in 2016 by the Bulford family that was hiking in the area. They contacted the Coast Guard shortly after the discovery, to share news of their find. 

In 2017, the Bulfords will complete the last year of deployment in Resolute Bay and wondered if CCGS Henry Larsen was going to be in the area this summer, and if the ship’s crew wanted to see the time capsule before returning it safely to where it was found before winter set in. A crew change in mid-September of 2017 enabled Captain Briggs to return to the ship, in Resolute Bay, in time to welcome all five Bulford family members onboard the icebreaker.  The time capsule was updated with a 2017 ship’s crew list and a list of CHS hydrographers. The Bulfords also included the story of how/when they found it. Who knows when it will be “rediscovered” or by who?
