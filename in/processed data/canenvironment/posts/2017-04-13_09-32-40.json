    "caption": "Scientists from around 10 agencies and institutes from all over the world are currently working together in the Arctic to measure ice on land and sea. This is one of the largest Arctic expedition ever! \ud83d\ude32This huge collaborative international effort will help ensure the ice-thickness maps created from satellite data are correct. We have a small crew over there that will be sharing photos and highlights (when they have access to the Internet \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). Check our account to follow their adventures! \ud83d\ude43\n\nPhoto 1 : Pilot Troy and scientist Christian measuring the thickness of the ice to make sure it can safely support the weight of the aircraft. \ud83d\udee9\n\nPhoto 2: Justin and Josh working on a snow pit to measure snow properties on multi-year sea ice north of Alert, Nunavut.\n\nPhoto 3: KBAL pilots preparing to land on the plane on sea ice without a prepared runway.\n\nPhoto 4: Arvids measuring the depth of snow on sea ice along a transect.
