Now that's a view!! ðŸ’™ The fabled #ChilkootTrail is centuries old, the #hike of a lifetime. Few trails of similar length offer more dramatic changes in climate, terrain and vegetation, or more spectacular #scenery. Amidst this rugged #northern #wilderness, an overlay of artefacts and #heritage landscape features tell the story of the Klondike Gold Rush, giving the trail a unique #historic flavour.
