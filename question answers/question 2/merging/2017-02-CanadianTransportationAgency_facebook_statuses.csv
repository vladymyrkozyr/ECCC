Air carriers have different policies regarding the carriage of pets. While some may accept pets as checked baggage or allow them to travel within the cabin with their owners, others may not. Before reserving space for your pet on your flights, ask your air carrier about its pet policy. Also contact the embassy or consulate of your destination country for specific restrictions, as well as the vaccinations and documentation required for pets entering other countries.

For the addresses and contact information of diplomatic and consular representatives accredited to Canada, consult the Country Travel Report for your destination at www.travel.gc.ca.
