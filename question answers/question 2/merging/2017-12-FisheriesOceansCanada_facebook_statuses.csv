Since its discovery in North America in the late 1980s, Tubenose Goby have been found in a few locations in the Great Lakes. To prevent the spread of this invasive species, never buy or use Tubenose Goby as bait, and never transfer live bait between waterbodies. It is against the law. Scientists are concerned about the possible long-term effects, because it can beat resident fish for habitat and food. This is a real concern for bottom-dwelling fishes, like Rainbow Darter and Northern Madtom.
