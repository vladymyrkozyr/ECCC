We can’t BEAR all of this cuteness!!!!!!!! Polar Bear Pass is one of Canada’s largest National Wildlife Areas and features unusual diversity of #wildlife for its latitude. The NWA supports at least 54 species of birds and various species of mammals. As the name implies, Polar Bears pass through the area in spring and summer on their way to Graham Moore Bay, to the southwest, an important feeding area where they find Walrus and Ringed Seals. 📸: Garry Donaldson
