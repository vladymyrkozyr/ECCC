The soil, as whole, (which would include both the clay particles in the soil and the minerals bound by the clay) actually has no electric charge. The negative charge of the clay particles is offset by the positive charge of the minerals. So, the soil actually has no polarity.

Although I highly doubt that the or so operations you know of can speak for the other organic farms in Canada. From this list ( I ) I see things such as lime sulphur, copper sulphate, pyrethrins, and Bt toxins. I also know that levels of pesticides in our food are at levels far below any maximum levels. Organic and conventional. And your right, a few studies showed that some organic produce had elevated levels of some anti-oxidants. Let's not forget that you would have to eat about kg of strawberries to see any positive effects from these slightly elevated levels. Also, some organic milk and beef showed elevated levels of Omega Fats. The problem is milk and beef are not proper sources of Omega /6 fats.

""This spring I was privileged to visit the Africa Centre for Holistic Management (ACHM) in Zimbabwe, and spend several days with Allan Savory, the pioneer and guru of holistic management and managed grazing. Savory is a research biologist who has faced his share of controversy over the years. And you start to get an idea of why this is so, when you hear him utter the phrase: “Only livestock can save us.” A more radical statement could hardly be uttered in this day and age. The media—from newscasts to environmental activists—all seem to agree on this one point: animals are the cause of global warming and we need fewer animals on the planet, not more, if we are to reverse desertification and restore the earth’s grasslands. Allan unabashedly holds and eresses his radically different opinion, at every turn. I was able to talk with him and see the results of his ideas applied practically at the ACHM last May. At this learning hub in Victoria Falls, the Savory Institute staff and volunteers manage the land in a way that is sustainable and regenerative.

""the solution to overgrazing is to manage the animals properly, overseeing their feeding patterns."" What precisely are you overseeing and managing that reduces the amount of plants livestock eat?

""Animals disturb the soil just enough to stimulate new growth and then they fertilize it with their own waste. No machine can do that."" This may be true, but there is simply too much animal waste being produced. Large quantities of it get dumped in the ocean causing ocean dead zones. Also, we don't need to be eating the animals in order for them to graze and fertilize land. . ""Even if cattle put out ten times the methane they did, even if every human didn’t eat meat, we’d still have to deal with desertification on a global scale, according to Allan."" What? Like... what? This just makes no sense. If we stopped raising animals for food there would be fewer animals producing methane thus less methane in the atmosphere. .

Several years ago a doctor conducted a test using the MRI to examine the brains of professed conservatives and liberals. Without going into long detail, the MRI noted the neurons of the conservatives would ""fire"" on both the left and right side of the brain, indicating that conservatives tap into both the rational and emotional sections of the brain when arguing their point or eressing their views. The liberals however, tapped mostly into their emotion half of the brain and were weak in their rational section (I'm making this brief and simple). His conclusion was that extreme liberals tend to be more emotional than rational in their reactions, when arguing their points. For example, liberals want our guns taken away yet refused to give up their armed body guards. They say climate change is caused by a carbon footprint, but they still fly in their private jets leaving that same footprint they scream about. They holler for ""tolerance,"" yet are the most intolerant toward others who differ with them. On news interviews, it is the liberals who raise their voices, scream, and turn red in the race when confronted and the conservative usually sits there shaking their head, talking calm (at least in most instances). In the recent ""woman's march,"" they women screamed, spewed hatred, used vulgarity, and made threats toward the President. When Obama was sworn in, no conservative group was burning cars, breaking glass or attacking police. In fact no conservative protest ever goes this far. It is ALWAYS and I mean ALWAYS the radical liberals. The doctor is correct. Extreme liberalism is a brain disorder and there is nothing they can do except scream, cuss, use irrational arguments that make no sense; have a double standard and remain mean spirited. This country is divided and will continue to be so, as extreme liberalism promotes extreme sins and the spirit of Jezebel is still alive in the earth. Just the other day it was reported that Trump had removed Martin Luther King Jr. bust from the Oval Office. It went viral and fed the liberal lie that Trump is racist! In fact the beautiful metal bust was on a table and a Secret Service agent was standing in front of it. Sounds like ""Fake News"" (hello CNN). He is supposed to hate immigrants, yet his wife is an immigrant, and he hired thousands of Hispanics in his construction and workplace. Thus, the irrational refuse the facts but prefer to ""fire"" on their emotional side, screaming and yelling, destroying property, to create havoc in the nation. Sounds like they need to get saved, get a renewed mind and learn to think with a saved heart and not a hard heart. We may disagree on some theories, theology, or even political ideas, but at least we conservatives use both side of our brains. - From Perry Stone Ministries",[],[],EXTREME LIBERALISM NEUROLOGICAL

Attributing the word ""sustainable"" to any form of raising ruminants requires an extremely myopic understanding of global depletion and non-scientific commentary like, ""best nutrition for their brain development"" (what nutrient is that?). What makes modern man intelligent is his cerebral cortex, which is used for understanding. Unfortunately, our collective brains are overruled by our taste buds.
