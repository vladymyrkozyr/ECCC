Hi everyone, and welcome to my summer home! 
Itâ€™s geophysicist Vicki Tschirhart here! 
My field site is located in the Patterson Lake corridor, southwestern Athabasca Basin, a region known for its uranium deposits. 
Our multidisciplinary field party includes geochemists, geochronologists, geophysicists and geologists, experts who have the collective goal of understanding how and why these deposits formed.
