    "caption": "How do you tag a snail? With nail polish, of course! And when you go back to recapture them a few days later, don\u2019t be surprised if they\u2019ve moved a surprisingly long way away.\n\nThis Oregon Forest Snail is red-listed in BC and only found in 19 sites in the southwest. Canadian Wildlife Service biologists were doing a mark-recapture study to determine habitat type and snail presence in one of the sites. It was a good chance to practice nail polish application skills, and a lesson learned in how to minimize the effects of stinging nettle!\n\nSometimes, you meet other friends, like this Northwestern Salamander, along the way.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#CanadianWildlife #Conservation #Snail #Snails #InstaSnails #BiologistsOfInstagram #CanadianWildlifeService #EnvironmentCanada",
