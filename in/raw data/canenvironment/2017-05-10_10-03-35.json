    "caption": "It may not look like much but over the last year, scientists have been using these new solar-powered satellite transmitters to tag and track Thayer\u2019s Gulls from the high arctic to BC. This data is helping scientists learn about the foraging and migrating behavior of this species, and how they overlap with areas of high marine shipping. \nRecently, a bird with a transmitter stopped moving. The signal remained strong, and coordinates indicated it was located in a remote area of Alaska. Scientists presumed the device lost until a local resident offered to help with the search. Equipped with his boat, GPS, and coordinates provided by ECCC, he found the transmitter on a remote beach off of Iyoukeen Bay \u2013 100km from #Juneau! Thanks Mr. Chew!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#MigratoryBirds #BritishColumbia #Arctic #Gull #Alaska #Nature #TenakeeSprings #WldlifeScience #MarineSafety #WildlifeConservation #CanEnvironment #EnvironmentCan #CanadianWildlife #OurCoasts",
