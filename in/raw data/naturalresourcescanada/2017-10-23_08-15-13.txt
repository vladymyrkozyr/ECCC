Here are two #CleanTech innovations that were showcased at the #GenEnergy forum!

The EV Garage is an interactive display designed to help Canadians explore and better understand electric vehicles and solar energy production for vehicles and buildings.

The Chevy Volt is a hybrid plug-in electric vehicle. The car uses the battery power until the battery is empty, at which point gas can be used. The Volt has regenerative braking to help charge the battery.
