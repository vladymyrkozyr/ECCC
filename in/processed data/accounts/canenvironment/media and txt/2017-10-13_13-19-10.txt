Canadaâ€™s 54 national wildlife areas (NWA) are created and managed for wildlife conservation, research and interpretation purposes under the Canada Wildlife Act and in accordance to the Wildlife Area Regulations. 
For many reasons, but primarily to facilitate the administration of national wildlife areas, we are currently considering amendments to the regulations to modernize them. 
We want to hear from YOU! Let us know what you think about the proposed amendments. TAP the link in our bio for more info. ðŸ“¸Pamela Sinclair
