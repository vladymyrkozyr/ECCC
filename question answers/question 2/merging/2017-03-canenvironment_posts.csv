The acoustic recorders intermittently turn on and record the songs of species such as the Threatened Canada Warbler, which can then be identified by trained staff to allow biologists to determine species abundance and distribution. It also helps biologists determine which habitats are used by forest birds. CWS biologists use these recorders to go along with surveys normally conducted by trained staff primarily in the month of June.In March, access to wet areas is easier on snowshoes, and allows biologists to capture data on resident species such as grouse, owls, chickadees and woodpeckers that breed earlier than migrants returning from the tropics.......",Canadian Wildlife Service CWS biologist Steve Van Wilgenburg Wildlife Tech Patrick Turgeon working weekend attaching automated recorders trees Greenwater Provincial Park SK assist CWS monitor boreal forest bird populations acoustic recorders intermittently turn record songs species Threatened Canada Warbler identified trained staff allow biologists determine species abundance distribution also helps biologists determine habitats used forest birds CWS biologists use recorders go along surveys normally conducted trained staff primarily month June nIn March access wet areas easier snowshoes allows biologists capture data resident species grouse owls chickadees woodpeckers breed earlier migrants returning tropics CanadianWildlifeService Fieldwork Biologists BiologistLife WildlifeMonitoring PerksOfFieldWork Snowshoe WithNature EnvironmentCanada ECcan150,"[""canadianwildlifeservice"",""fieldwork"",""biologists"",""biologistlife"",""wildlifemonitoring"",""perksoffieldwork"",""snowshoe"",""withnature"",""environmentcanada"",""eccan150""]",0,56,56,Environmental,en,0.0,canenvironment_instagram,"['wildlife', 'or', 'nature', 'tree', 'populations', 'park', 'ice', 'species', 'water', 'bird']",neutral
