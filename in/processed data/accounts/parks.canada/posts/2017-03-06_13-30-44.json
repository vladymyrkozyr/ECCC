    "caption": "Not only is the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac the most photographed hotel in the world, it is also one of our most stunning national historic sites! It was built in 1892 in the tradition of ch\u00e2teau-style hotels developed by railway companies across Canada. You can admire a similar hotel in Lake Louise, #Banff.
