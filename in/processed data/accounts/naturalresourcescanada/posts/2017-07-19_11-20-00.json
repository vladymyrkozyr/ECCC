Eric studies how and why these uranium deposits formed. \nFor this project, Eric is looking for ancient chemical fingerprints of fluids that formed these deposits. This research is attempting to create a way of identifying faults that channeled the uranium-bearing fluids to the site of the deposit and addressing questions on how the deposits form. \n#fieldwork #uranium #exploration",
