cliffLAND: “…where nature remains wild and self-willed, ministering to our need for beauty and inspiration," - Howard Clifford. 
cliffLAND Conservation Area is owned by the Clifford Family and is a special piece of the Canadian Shield that meets the limestone of the east and south. It is made unique by an underlay of marble that produces an incredible richness of biodiversity. A Canada 150 plaque is being installed on this property to honour the donor’s conservation efforts. 
cliffLAND was donated as part of Environment and Climate Change Canada’s Ecological Gifts program, and is forever protected by the Mississippi Madawaska Land Trust. The Ecological Gifts Program offers tax benefits to landowners who donate land to be preserved for the rest of time.
