Ever heard of Boot Island National Wildlife Area? Boot Island is located in the upper Bay of Fundy so when Andrew and Garry, from the Canadian Wildlife Service visited the island to improve the signage, they had to time their trip carefully to avoid hauling the Zodiac over hundreds of meters of mud. Yup, field work can be quite the adventure!
