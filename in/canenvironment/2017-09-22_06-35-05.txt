We are creating a souvenir album celebrating 100 years of bird conservation in Canada! Share with us your bird anecdotes or thoughts on birds today! The album will be a tribute to birds and all those who love them, volunteer bird observers, or those who have even devoted their career to bird conservation. The album will contain testimonials and photos of 100 people.

Here’s how to participate :
. Write a 100-word anecdote about your work with birds, bird encounters or about your love of birds.
·  Let us know your name and send a self-portrait taken outdoors (300 dpi);
·  List your 5 favorite birds.
