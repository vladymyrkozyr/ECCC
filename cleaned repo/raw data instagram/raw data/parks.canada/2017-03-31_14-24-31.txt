A visit to #ElkIslandNationalPark is sure to be unforgettable!! Elk Island is not only an important refuge for #bison, elk and more than 250 bird species, but it's also an #oasis of calm for day picnickers and overnight #campers alike. If you're lucky, you might even catch a stunning #sunset like this one.
