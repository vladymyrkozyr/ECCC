Just a couple of Northern Fulmars arguing about their resting spot on Prince Leopold Island\u2026nothing a human couple wouldn\u2019t do!\n\nPrince Leopold Island #MigratoryBird Sanctuary supports large numbers of four nesting #seabird species, including Thick-billed Murre, Northern Fulmar, Black-legged Kittiwake and Black Guillemot. The sanctuary is one of the most important multi-species seabird colonies in the Arctic, and is an important site for seabird research. Seabird monitoring has been ongoing since 1975, generating one of the strongest datasets for seabird monitoring in the #Arctic.
