Alvan is a Canadian who was in between his undergrad and medical school the summer he volunteered for us. Our volunteers come from all backgrounds, ages and experiences and in this case, we were fortunate because Alvan already had banding experience from his other volunteer gigs. Alvan will be Dr. Alvan, MD when he joins us again this coming summer in a different part of the arctic on a different component of the Program!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#NationalVolunteerWeek2017 #NationalVolunteerWeek #Volunteering #SkilledVolunteers #CitizenScientists #ClosetBirdNerds #CenterForConservationBiology #ArcticShorebirdMonitoringProgram #CanadianWildlifeService #MigratoryBirds #CanadianVolunteers #InternationalVolunteers #MigratoryConnectivity #KendallIsland #FieldWork",
