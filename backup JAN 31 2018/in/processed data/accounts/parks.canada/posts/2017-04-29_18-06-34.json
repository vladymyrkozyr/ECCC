    "caption": "Situated in the Columbia Mountains, Glacier National Park's 1349 km2 of peaks, glaciers and forest straddle the crest of the Selkirk Range, an area of legendary snowfall. If you plan to tour in Glacier National Park, be aware that many areas of the park have restricted and prohibited access to protect backcountry users from avalanche control. \nGreat shot submitted by @jorunswild for our Sunrise #ParksChallenge! Stay tuned next Thursday for your next challenge! \n#explorecanada #explorebc #selkirks #rogerspass #glacier #glaciernp #backcountry #skiing #skitouring #travel #travelphotography #nature #naturelovers #naturephotography #wild #conservation #wildlifephotography #photooftheday #travel #instagood #beautiful #photography #outdoors #adventure #landscape #naturephotography #parkscanada #canada150 #canada"
