Canada is home to 532 species who are at risk due to ecosystem degradation and loss. It is up to all Canadians to work together to help protect and conserve their habitat. Today, a newly formed advisory committee met with Minister McKenna to find practical solutions for these creatures. By working together, we can safeguard the health of our Canadian wildlife and ecosystems!
