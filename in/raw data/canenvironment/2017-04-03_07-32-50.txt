This Semipalmated #Plover, was banded in June 2010 at Fish Island in the Mackenzie Delta, Northwest Territories just outside the Kendall Island Migratory Bird Sanctuary. 
The bird was first spotted that fall on southward migration at Marco Island, Florida by Dave Addison who was doing surveys of Florida’s beaches. The bird was inadvertently given the name “Smile”… #longstory and it has stuck! 
Smile has since visited the same stretch of beach on nearly every spring (northward) and fall (southward) migration! He was last seen fueling up #YummyWorms for the rest of his southbound migration at Marco Island this past fall. #FloridaWormsMustBeDelicious 
We can’t wait to hear if Smile is seen again on Marco Island this April! 
These photos of “Smile” can’t help but make one smile! Smiling Face With Smiling Eyes .
