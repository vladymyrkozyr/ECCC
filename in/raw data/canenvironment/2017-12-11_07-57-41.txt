Canadian Wildlife Service Species at Risk biologist, Dr. Wellicome, trains a field technician to use a scope to view the underground nest of a Burrowing Owl. The scope feeds live infrared video to a pair of goggles, allowing the user to count how many adult owls, owlets, eggs, and cached prey are inside the burrow. Using a hood helps block out daylight glare to get a clearer image in the gOWLggles.
