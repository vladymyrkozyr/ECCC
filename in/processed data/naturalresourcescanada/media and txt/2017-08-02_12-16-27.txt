What will it take to fight #ClimateChange? 
A team of the best clean energy “nerds” in Canada! One self-proclaimed “GHG nerd” is Anamika, who was profiled as part of the #GenEnergy initiative. 
Anamika works with Cenovus Energy to find ways to produce oil efficiently while reducing the impact of climate change. “We live in a time where the world wants answers from energy sources and [wants to] transition towards a clean energy future. And as an industry, if we are to be sustainable, it is our responsibility to be part of that clean energy future,” Anamika said.
