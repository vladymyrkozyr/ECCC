48,CanadianAgriculture_facebook,"What’s the difference between apple cider and apple juice? Preservability, for one.

Apple cider is raw apple juice that hasn’t been filtered to remove pulp and sediment. It starts to ferment in about a week, so it’s mostly a seasonal beverage. Pasteurization can extend its shelf-life but can also make it taste bitter.

Apple juice starts out as apple cider and is then filtered to remove pulp and sediment. It can take up to 20 hours to filter really clear apple juice! But not anymore. Click to read how electroflotation makes clear and stable apple juice. http://ow.ly/uXHs30aLwl6",unknown
