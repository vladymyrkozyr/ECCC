Another field season comes to a close for half of the #arcticshorebirdmonitoringprogram team {the Nanuit Itillinga (Polar Bear Pass) National Wildlife Area Tier2/intensive camp crew is still out until the end of July}. Ending off the Tier1/rapid crew posts with selfie montages! #almostasphotogenicasthelandscape #awesomeweathereverydaybutone #birdmonitoring #canadianwildlifeservice
