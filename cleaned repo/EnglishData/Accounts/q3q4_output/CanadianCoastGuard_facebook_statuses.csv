Private James Peter Robertson was awarded posthumously the Victoria Cross for his extraordinary valour and devotion to duty while facing a hostile force in one of the most significant battles in World War I, at Passchendaele Belgium.

CP commissioned the plaque at the request of CP engineer Darrel Sundholm of Calgary Alberta. “After his family moved from Springhill Nova Scotia to Medicine Hat Alberta, James Peter Robertson joined the Canadian Pacific Railway, working his way up to locomotive engineer. He earned his nickname “Singing Pete” for his cheerful singing and whistling, whether in the cab or at the roundhouse,” said Sundholm. “The bravery that earned him the Victoria Cross made him a legend among locomotive engineers the world over.”

Steve Pauley, Commanding Officer of the Canadian Coast Guard ship named in Robertson's honour stated at the ceremony “In this, the 100th year anniversary of his death, it is our honour to share the story of Private Robertson’s service to our country and remember his ultimate sacrifice with dignity and respect.” Pauley added “This plaque will educate all who step aboard this ship for many years to come.”","The Canadian Coast Guard, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian Pacific Railway paid homage to a true Canadian hero with the unveiling of a commemorative plaque aboard the Canadian Coast Guard Ship Private Robertson V.C. in Burlington Ontario December .

Byron Briggs, the current Commanding Officer of CCGS Henry Larsen, was part of that 1997 crew list as the Second Officer. The time capsule was later discovered in 2016 by the Bulford family that was hiking in the area. They contacted the Coast Guard shortly after the discovery, to share news of their find. 

In 2017, the Bulfords will complete the last year of deployment in Resolute Bay and wondered if CCGS Henry Larsen was going to be in the area this summer, and if the ship’s crew wanted to see the time capsule before returning it safely to where it was found before winter set in. A crew change in mid-September of 2017 enabled Captain Briggs to return to the ship, in Resolute Bay, in time to welcome all five Bulford family members onboard the icebreaker.  The time capsule was updated with a 2017 ship’s crew list and a list of CHS hydrographers. The Bulfords also included the story of how/when they found it. Who knows when it will be “rediscovered” or by who?

Starting with a visit to the NFMTC college by CCGS Henry Larsen’s Commanding Officer Neil MacDonald, it was followed up by two days of shipboard training and information sharing. 
 
On Wednesday, November 8th, the NFMTC Bridge Watch Rating class was enthusiastically welcomed aboard CCGS Henry Larsen by Captain MacDonald and his crew. A total of 14 students and staff were divided into three groups and sent to various work stations onboard the icebreaker. They learned about anchoring operations and how a windlass works. They were briefed on launching lifeboats during rescue operations; and about the safe operation of deck machinery including mooring and towing winches. As well, they learned how to steer a large vessel while underway as they pulled up the anchor and sailed in Frobisher Bay for a few hours. The enthusiastic and supportive crew were also able to describe shipboard life and share their experiences working with the Coast Guard. 
 
Captain Phil Hillier, NFMTC, noted that for many students, being on board a vessel of this size was a first for most and that being able not only see how the ship operates but also to actually have hands-on experience was very important in supplementing what is taught at the marine college. Captain Hillier was confident that this experience will motivate the students to want to further a career in the marine industry.","Weeks of planning paid off for the Nunavut Fisheries and Marine Training Consortium, NFMTC, in Iqaluit and the Canadian Coast Guard. Starting with a visit to the NFMTC college by CCGS Henry Larsen’s Commanding Officer Neil MacDonald, it was followed up by two days of shipboard training and information sharing. On Wednesday, November th, the NFMTC Bridge Watch Rating class was enthusiastically welcomed aboard CCGS Henry Larsen by Captain MacDonald and his crew. A total of students and staff were divided into three groups and sent to various work stations onboard the icebreaker. They learned about anchoring operations and how a windlass works. They were briefed on launching lifeboats during rescue operations; and about the safe operation of deck machinery including mooring and towing winches. As well, they learned how to steer a large vessel while underway as they pulled up the anchor and sailed in Frobisher Bay for a few hours. The enthusiastic and supportive crew were also able to describe shipboard life and share their eeriences working with the Coast Guard. Captain Phil Hillier, NFMTC, noted that for many students, being on board a vessel of this size was a first for most and that being able not only see how the ship operates but also to actually have hands-on eerience was very important in supplementing what is taught at the marine college. Captain Hillier was confident that this eerience will motivate the students to want to further a career in the marine industry.",[],23,0,12,23,0,0,0,0,0,0,35,en,0.0,CanadianCoastGuard_facebook,neutral,"['nunavut', 'marine', 'canadian', 'coast', 'guard', 'guard', 'college', 'student', 'safe', 'coast', 'guard', 'guard', 'student', 'marine', 'college', 'student', 'marine', 'industry']",Social,"['marine', 'coast', 'operation', 'operation', 'operation', 'coast', 'marine', 'marine', 'industry']",Clean growth

This full day of training also included an opportunity for crew to share a meal with the eager students and staff. Of note, CCGS Henry Larsen’s ST Engineer Dan White not only eagerly elained the duties of an engine room officer on watch to the students but also celebrated years of service with Coast Guard that very same day! Captain Peter Richards, NFMTC, eressed in a note to Captain MacDonald afterwards, that the entire class was extremely pleased with the day onboard the ship. He said that the crew did a fantastic job showing the workings of the ship, were informative, engaging and very keen to share their knowledge and eeriences. Citing this as an immense learning opportunity, Captain Richards feels this will give the students other career options when considering a future in the marine industry.
