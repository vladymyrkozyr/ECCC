Montreal youth attending the “Futurs Génies” day camp will have a great story to tell about their holidays when they head back to class! After all it’s not every day you get to name and build a replica of a massive construction machine.

And the winning name was Poseidon, which fittingly captures the machine’s impressive strength and important mission – placing large pieces of the new Champlain Bridge weighing up to 1,000 tonnes on the floor of the St. Lawrence.

Campers from the science and engineering camp offered through the École de Technologie supérieure, participated in the competition run by Signature on the Saint Lawrence (SSL), the private partner responsible for the New Champlain Bridge Corridor Project and local MP Mark Miller joined SSL to announce the winners.","Introducing Poseidon, the recently named Floating Foundation Installer (FFI) operating on the new Champlain Bridge worksite.
