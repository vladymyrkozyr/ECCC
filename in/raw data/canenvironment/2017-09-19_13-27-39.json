    "caption": "We captured this wonderful moment during Canadian Wildlife Service\u2019s First Annual Mentored Hunt, at Last Mountain Lake National Wildlife Area. Our participants learned so much about ethical and sustainable hunting from our wonderful mentors!\n\nWith this event, we were able to show people that hunting waterfowl actually helps maintain the population in several ways. Snow Geese, for example, have a current population of over 6 billion. Their nesting grounds are becoming so overpopulated that it is destroying the habitat for other wildlife in the region. Hunting not only helps maintain these populations, but also helps us raise money for conservation, restoration, and enhancement of wildlife habitat in Canada through the purchase of necessary documents such as the Canadian Wildlife Habitat Conservation Stamp.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#MentoredHunt #Conservation #NationalWildlifeArea #ConnectWithNature #WithNature #Waterfowl #CanadianWildlifeService #Ducks #BirdConservation #HabitatConservation #NatureConservation #ProtectedArea #Saskatchewan #ExploreCanada #ExploreSK",
