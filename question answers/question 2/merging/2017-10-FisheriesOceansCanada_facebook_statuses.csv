Grass Carp have a wide, scaleless head, toothless mouth, no barbels, and a very short snout. They are dark grey with lighter sides (white to yellow) that have a slightly golden shine. Their scales are large with dark edges, and their fins are clear to grey-brown. Adult Grass Carp mostly eat aquatic vegetation. If you think you’ve found a Grass Carp, put it on ice (do not freeze) and contact the Invading Species Hotline at: 1-800-563-7711 (in Ontario), or visit http://ow.ly/sEyG30g4ft4","If you are a boater or a fisher, it’s important to learn to identify invasive species like Grass Carps.
