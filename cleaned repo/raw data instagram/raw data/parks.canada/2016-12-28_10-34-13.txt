With Canada 150 around the corner and 2017 trips already in the planning stages, we would like to remind you to take a breather and include scenic views in your itinerary! We've placed our Parks Canada red chairs in breathtaking spots in order for you to do just that! Don't forget to tag us and #ShareTheChair! PHOTO ðŸ“· @now.its.chow.time
