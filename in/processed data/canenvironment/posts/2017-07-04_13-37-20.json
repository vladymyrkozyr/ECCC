    "caption": "Meet wildlife biologist Sabina and wildlife technician Regina. Their work focuses on conserving and protecting seabirds, some of which are at-risk. Recently an apparently injured Northern Fulmar seabird was found on an offshore support vessel near Newfoundland and Labrador. The fulmar features large black eyes and a striking short, tube-like beak and resembles a gull; however it is actually related to the albatross and shearwater. It breeds in a few dozen scattered locations off Alaska and Canada, but is more abundant in the northeast Atlantic. \nOnce the bird was delivered to the Canadian Wildlife Service lab, Sabina and Regina examined it, determined that it wasn\u2019t injured, and decided it was ready for release. They took it to Witless Bay where a small colony of other fulmars breeds on three islands in the area. They watched the bird drink and vigorously bathe until it swam out of range toward the mouth of the bay.  We\u2019re excited about this happy ending!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#CanadianWildlifeService #Conservation #Wildlife #Fieldwork #Fulmar #NorthernFulmar #SeaBirds #BiologistsOfInstagram #Biologist #Biologists #BirdLovers #BirdNerds #InstaBird #InstaBirds #CanEnvironment #EnvironmentCanada",
