It's in need of help, and should get it, plus a proper visitor center to interpret its history and association with Harriet Tubman. It might then join with two other Tubman sites in the US to form an International Historical Park. That would raise its profile to a level deserving of such a site. https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/12/29/church-attended-by-harriet-tubman-in-need-of-repairs-trustee-says.html Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park Harriet Tubman Home, Authentic and Historic [[PHOTO]]",2017-12-30 01:29:20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,25-34

It's a nod to the park's centennial in 2018. Unfortunately, however, the stamp is terribly small, and the white border around the picture shrinks the image even further. It's a $1.20 stamp, which matches the first-class rate to the US, but it can certainly be used on domestic mail. Canada Post [[PHOTO]]",2017-12-29 20:50:05,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,22-24

December 17 marked King's birthday. Did the site do anything special? 

Woodside closed for the season on December 23, and will not reopen until NEXT OCTOBER. It is shameful for a national park system unit to be closed so much of the year, denying visitors the opportunity of seeing this treasure.

Woodside also lacks a visitor center to interpret the life and accomplishments of history's longest-serving prime minister. Its newest addition is an impressive picnic shelter/prep kitchen on the site of a historic coach house, long since gone. But a visitor centre is what's needed, including a gift shop. The current 'shop' is an anemic shelf display of a half dozen items, most of them not related to King or Woodside. It's embarrassing.

One of my most memorable moments of 2017 is pictured here. I had arrived in Banff, and had to wait for a parking spot at busy Moraine Lake. I started chatting with a bus driver and mentioned that I couldn't believe the people on the Rock Pile. He told me to go do it. I am terrified of heights and knew that would be far outside my comfort zone. He told me several more times that I needed to do it. I walked around the lake for a bit and couldn't shake the feeling that I sort of wanted to try. Clearly, you can see that I did make it up on my jello legs. I shook the whole time and was embarrassingly encouraged by fellow walkers, but it was worth it! Just stunning! When I came down, a beautiful butterfly landed on my shoulder. I am so thankful to that bus driver. I wish he had been there to thank in person when I was done. What a view it was! I cannot wait to go back! [[PHOTO]]",2017-12-28 12:15:23,10,6,4,0,0,0,0,0,25-34

I've dreamt of going to the East Coast... It took me 50 years... but my husband and I drove from Ontario to most of the Maritime provinces in 7 days. Although Peggy's Cove was my one spot I had to experience... ( more than I expected 🙂)... Anne of Green Gables and Cabot Trail were the two official Parks Canada sites we visited. They didn't disappoint either! We did travel to see other beautiful sites as well... it's a trip that should be on everyone's ""Bucket List"" to do, at least once! We have such a beautiful Country... and should be experienced in person ... ""Oh Canada, our Home and Native Land!"" 🇨🇦️ [[PHOTO]]",2017-12-28 20:12:49,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,55 and more

It taught me that I was capable to continue a journey even in the hardest of situations. I made it to the end of the trail, had a meltdown and found resolve even in the biggest upset. I still have no idea how I didn’t get hypothermia in the cold Fundy fog (had no idea fog could get that cold) in the middle of August. I’m still a rookie trail adventurer but learned lots.

I've been thinking all morning of this momentous trip, trying to pick one photo, one park, one experience, that defined our journey through these provinces, and was unable to choose.  While each of the parks was stunning in its own display of lakes and rivers, peaks and valleys, animals and birds, plants and trees, I was most impressed by the staff who worked all hours, the interpreters who taught all ages, the rangers who protected all areas, the firefighters who managed all fires, and the road crews who directed all travelers in and around the parks.  We had a most glorious time learning more about this amazing country we call home, and I would like to commend Parks Canada for all the work it does to preserve the local environments and stories of this land.  We can't wait to return in 2018.

Our husky doesn't react to them so the shepherd learned from her not to as well.  The husky can be left outside alone with it, although she does get worried when it wanders to close to her!

When Neil Lynch asked which park units folks visited in 2017, it got me counting, for I knew it was a big year, personally. Thank you, Neil. I never would have totaled them, otherwise. The result: 49 park system units last year. The 150th year of Confederation, combined with free admission to Parks Canada sites, led me to visit and re-visit several in Ontario and Quebec, plus the USA. The tally and list:

Ontario: 16
Quebec: 20
USA:   13
Total: 49 national park units
