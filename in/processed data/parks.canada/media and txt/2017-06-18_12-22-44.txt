Head deeper and higher into the woodsâ€¦ Located in New Brunswick on Canadaâ€™s Atlantic Coast, Fundy National Park offers more than just dramatic tides. More than 100 kilometres of hiking and biking trails ribbon through 206 square kilometres of Acadian forest, leading to thundering waterfalls, freshwater lakes and scenic river valleys. ðŸ“· by @daniellelate
