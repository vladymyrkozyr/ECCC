Though #Tintamarre is said to translate from an old French word meaning "loud noises", there was nothing boisterous about this delightfully calm day on frozen Jolicure Lake in Tintamarre National Wildlife Area, located 15 minutes from Sackville, NB and Amherst, NS. Grab your snowshoes or cross-country skis and experience this peaceful landscape!  #NB #NewBrunswick #Sackville #Snowshoeing #Ski #WinterFun #WinterJoy #WinterLandscape #CanadianWinter #WinterInCanada #CanadianWeather #NationalWildlifeArea #Conservation #Canada150 #ConnectWithNature #WorldEnvironmentDay #TimeToConnect #HiddenGems #CanadianWildlifeService #AtlanticCanada #NatureLover #NatureFun #Outdoors #CanEnvironment #EnvironmentCanada
