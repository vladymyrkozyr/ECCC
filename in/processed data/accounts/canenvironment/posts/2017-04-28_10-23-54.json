    "caption": "As mentioned earlier this week, the Canadian Wildlife Service\u2019s Arctic Shorebird Monitoring Program has been fortunate to have over 25 volunteers assist with our field program over the past 18 years! Highlighting just five this week has been an awesome opportunity, but a big round of thanks to all of you others out there!!! Mark Dodds, seen here with a Black-bellied Plover he just fitted with a satellite backpack, is one of these awesome volunteers. Mark turned down paying jobs to come work with us for free!! His time helped us have our best field season at our study site at Nanuit Itillinga (Polar Bear Pass) National Wildlife Area in terms of number of nests found and birds banded. The satellite backpacks Mark helped deploy are allowing us to see what routes these plovers are using to migrate, where they are spending the non-breeding season and what habitats they are using. This is all important information we need to help conserve this species.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#NationalVolunteerWeek #NationalVolunteerWeek2017 #ShoreBirdMonitoring #ShoreBirds #CanadianVolunteers #ArcticShorebirdMonitoringProgram #CanadianWildlifeService #CanadianWildlife #Arctic #ArcticScience #SkilledVolunteers #FieldWork #ArcticFieldWork #EnvironmentCanada",
