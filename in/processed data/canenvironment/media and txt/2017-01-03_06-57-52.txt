Tag a friend who canâ€™t compete with puffins! 
The Tufted #Puffin spends most of its life at sea, comingÂ  to land only to breed during a few critical months. Puffins are powerful flyers, beating their wings 300-400 times a minute to achieve speeds up to 64 kph (40 mph). That would have just about any human puff-in through the day. ðŸ“·: Catherine Jardine, Birds Studies Canada
