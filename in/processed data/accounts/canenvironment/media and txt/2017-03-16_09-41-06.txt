A bunch of â€˜bous Deer ðŸ¦Œ seen by biologists while travelling the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road to do station maintenance on song recorders.

Not only do the Automated Recording Units capture bird calls, but they also  record the sounds of caribou, moose, bears and other wildlife! Some of the recording stations have a wildlife camera at them too!
