Mission Monarch monitoring is officially underway at Long Point, Prince Edward Point and St. Clair National Wildlife Areas for this summer!

In an effort to implement conservation measures under the Monarch management plan, Environment and Climate Change Canada staff and volunteers are heading out to the National Wildlife Areas to look for and report sightings of Monarch eggs, caterpillars, and adult butterflies.

You can help! Join Mission Monarch and report milkweed and Monarch sightings in your area: www.mission-monarch.org
