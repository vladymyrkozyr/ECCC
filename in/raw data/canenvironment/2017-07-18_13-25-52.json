    "caption": "Roseate Terns like to nest in places with a bit of overhead cover to help protect them from birds like gulls and ravens that may steal their eggs. This might include spaces under rocks or vegetation, but they also might take advantage of a man-made shelter like this one. Biologists on Country Island keep an eye on them to watch their progress in laying their eggs, incubating, and feeding the chicks until they fledge. The marker R401 identifies the nest for the records. \ud83d\udcf8 Garry Donaldson\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#MigratoryBirds #Wildlife #Art #Photography #NaturePhotography #Birds #RoseateTerns #Science #EnvironnementCanada #EnvironmentCanada",
