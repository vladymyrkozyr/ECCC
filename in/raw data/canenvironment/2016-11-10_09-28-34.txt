Oh BUOY! What a boat!⛴ Come on board! The Canadian Coast Guard Ship (CCGS) Limnos calls Burlington, Ontario, its home, where it is docked at the Canada Centre for Inland Water (more often than knot). Puns are totally intended. 😉

Taking its name from “limnology,” the study of inland waters, CCGS Limnos is the dedicated scientific vessel for our environmental research and monitoring on the Great Lakes. It is capable of sampling the water, using a wide array of equipment, and it is equipped with an on-board laboratory for the processing and analysis of samples. How neat is that?
